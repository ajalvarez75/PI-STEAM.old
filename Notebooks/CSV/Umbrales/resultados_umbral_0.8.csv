Gostaria de uma atualização e um polimento melhor, isso sempre acontesse com o PC que é deixado de lado, e desta vez a Talltele, me deixou muito triste, pois esta empresa tinha tradição e este jogo é feito com base em uma engine que não tem motivos para dar esse tipo de Bug, a não ser que a coisa tenha sido mal feita mesmo!?Assim que eles melhorarem ( e tomara que não seja como o Batman Arkhan Kinght) eu tiro este análise e até recomendo! torço para isso!",wilsonufs,http://steamcommunity.com/id/wilsonufs,0
