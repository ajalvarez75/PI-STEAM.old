The North American shut down, leaving only European servers. As an Australian, I rarely, if ever, get a stable connection to Europe. i.e, I can't play the game at all. I can't even launch it.EDIT: I managed to get into the game. It looks okay, loading time is a little long for what the game looks like. But that's okay. I managed to get into a match, even with enough people in the queue I think they were all AI's, they had first/last names. Maybe the playerbase is just weird. The big problem was aforementioned connection issues. I couldn't do anything, Moving was constant rubber banding between where I started and where I was trying to move to.Don't get me wrong, it looks like a decent game. I'd play this. But I can't recommend it with such atrocious servers, and not even having servers for everyone else.

After who knows how many year this game is still absolute junk on pc. Good luck as this game was designed for the console peasant industry. Terrible pc optimization and mechanics is something which plague GTA IV. Also you NEED SIGN UP FOR GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE which is to put in words the S.H.I.T.I.E.S.T service ever... EVEN WORSE THEN ORIGIN, to SAVE YOUR GAME. AND on top of that you also need to sign up for some rockstar account to play online. FFS the game is on steam, not like DRM is going to make a difference as steam is an excellent service. PLEASE dont repeat the same S.H.I.T for GTA V. PLEASE NO DRM.

Codemasters have taken a grant-bribe from Oculus to buy platform exclusivity. No reason this couldn't have been delivered using open source Steam VR. Codies' PR team are busy fobbing off questions about Vive compatibility with evasive corporatespeak drivel while, presumably, lighting Cuban cigars with dirty $100 notes from the Facebook coffers. What next? Games you can't play with mouse/keyboard control unless you're a Logitech customer? nVidia only software which refuses to run for AMD users? Software which only works on a Samsung monitor (thanks for the brown paper envelope, guys).It sucks, and is of no benefit to the consumer. The PC platform's strength is broad compatibility regardless of who manufactures the components or peripherals. This is the thin end of the wedge, and PC gamers should stand together in giving a well deserved collective middle finger to anyone involved in these shabby practices.Oh, and as far as the review goes, I couldn't play the game in VR because Codemasters were bribed into avoiding the de facto OpenVR standard in favour of locking down the hardware with Oculus' proprietory drivers, so....That's a huge thumbs down and a generous 2 testicles/10 rating for this one.

It was really fun with friends, I didn't even mind the microtransactions as much as other people though they are by far the worst point of the game.My problems started late 2015 when I started to realise that my hard drive was full. I do, like a lot of people, have a lot of other larger games installed so I checked them to see if that was pushing me over quota. They weren't. I then checked some of the smaller games, one of which was Payday 2. It now holds the record of being the largest game that i've ever installed, and since every new microtransa- I mean, 'update' they add puts another 5gb-9gb on my disk, I decided to uninstall.The microtransactions, while I didn't find them irritating at first, now they are holding the game down. The GOTY edition helped, but 'helping' a problem and 'fixing' a problem are two different things. On a 75% off sale, the DLC is $33. Unacceptable. Don't get me wrong though, this is a fun game, and I've sunk 257 hours into messing around with mates as a result of that. But the things that turned us away from this game are the over-priced microtransactions, the high file size and repeated broken promises made by the lying developers that we used to trust and respect.",deltalink21,http://steamcommunity.com/id/deltalink21,0

That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros: -Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies. -You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me.

Even if you get this game for free, it isn't worth playing it due to insane life monsters spawning from nowhere, deaths without any apparent reason and things like those. I also need to mention that the screen sometimes freeze and blackout even with no apparent consumption of computer resources. I understand that the Gamemaker platform is a little bit hard to work with but this game shouldn't be considered finished due to these problems, so I already tried a refund request(even with 4 hours of ""gameplay"", or pure stress if you prefer), and even if it doesn't work, I hope someone reads this and pay attention to know that buying this game is a peril to your mental sanity.

Now, it feels like all of that work I put into this game was for nothing. While there is still a chance for this game to redeem itself and remove the stupid Microtransactions, I don't think it'll ever be the same. It truly disappoints me that the developers have turned this amazing game into ""pay to win"" crap. I would like to thank the developers for allowing me to have fun with friends, meet lots of new ones with this game, but now, I'm done with this game. This was such a great community, but it feels like Overkill has truly ruined it and angered a lot of people, including yours truly. Maybe eventually they'll see how silly this idea is and remove the microtransactions, but one can only hope. After all, we were promised from launch that we wouldn't have to deal with microtransactions. This is truly a disappointment, and I'm sorry to anyone else who feels this way.

1 person found this review funny,"Posted September 7, 2014.",,236430,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"Com o sucesso estrondoso de Dark Souls era mais do que esperado uma sequencia, mas como todo jogo muito bom, sequencias dão medo pela maioria das vezes não conseguirem ser tão bons quanto os seus originais. Dark Souls 2 não faz parte dessa maioria.Como no primeiro de sua serie o foco do jogo é sobre a maldição (curse), que quando infecta um humano não permite sua morte, mas o ressucita cada vez com menos sanidade e humanidade ate o ponto onde ele fica totalmente insano e selvagem.Centenas de milenios apos os acontecimentos de Dark Souls, Você é introduzido ao seu personagem que esta amaldiçoado, porem, ainda mantem sua sanidade e esta a procura de uma cura, isso o leva a procura por Drangleic, um reino onde se acredita que tenha a resposta contra essa maldição, ao chegar em tal mundo você descobre que nem tudo é como você esperava.Assim como em Dark Souls a historia do jogo é minimalista, para entender tudo é necessario conversar com todos os personagens, ler as descrições de itens e reparar nos visual deslumbrantes que escondem o passado deste reino misterioso. o jogo não lhe apresenta nenhum objetivo, nenhum indicador de onde você deve ir ou algum caminho especifico mas confia em você para explorar sozinho e encontrar seu proprio caminho.O foco de gameplay é seu sistema de combate, simples em primeira mão mas que se torna complexo com o passar do tempo.apesar de ser um rpg onde você pode aumentar status, trocar de equipamento e forjar armas, o jogo aposta mais na sua capacidade de se adaptar aos diferente tipos de inimigos e seus ataques, desde o mais simples esqueleto ao enorme dragão que cospe fogo. a variedade de equipamentos e armas usaveis são mais aproveitaveis ainda quando não se há a limitação por classes ou seja, você pode usar uma espada enorme em uma mão enquanto na  outra desfere magias devastadoras com um cajado, o que balanceia isso é a necessidade de status para que possa se usar com eficiencia essas mecanicas, mas como no jogo não há limite de leveis e você pode relocar seus pontos de status é um alivio para quem não gosta de seguir builds de ponta a ponta. o jogo no inicio te introduz algumas classes porem elas só definem seu equipamento inicial e seus pontos iniciais, elas não limitam o que você pode ser. Seu dinheiro e experiencia são uma coisa só: almas que são obtidas derrotando inimigos ou usando itens, mas há um porem, quando morto você perdera todas suas almas e para recuperalas tera que voltar onde morreu, se nesse meio tempo for morto de novo, adeus a tudo que conseguiu.Os visuais tambem não deixam a desejar, com vistas epicas e inimigos enormes você sempre estara impresionado com o que acontece a sua volta, os minimos detalhes que escondem a historia deste reino perdido são suas pistas para descobrir o que aconteceu, e claro o ambiente, a musica te da uma imersão ainda maior, em um mundo depressivo onde a desgraça caiu sobre os humanos você percebe esse ar gotico e sua orchestra funebreSeu sistema multiplayer consiste em algo unico, cada jogador tem seu mundo e suas ações são independentes em outros mundos porem você pode influenciar outros jogadores com mensagens deixadas no chão ou ate mesmo com poças de sangue que mostram como você morreu, esse recurso é usado para que o jogador aprenda sobre o que vai acontecer e o que pode fazer para evitar. mais influente ainda você pode ser invocado a outro mundo como um fantasma que vai ajudar o dono do mundo a matar os inimigos mas tambem você pode invadir outros mundos para matar seu dono e obter suas almasassim é o sistema cooperativo e PVP do jogoO unico erro é o design das fases que as vezes quebram um pouco da imersão total do jogo e algumas fases que parecem ter sido feitas as pressas pela sua simplicidade, mas nem todas são assimMas o que faz esse jogo tão aclamado? simples. Sua dificuldade.Dark Souls II faz jus ao seu antecessor nesta questão, o jogo não te introduz dicas,marcações,fraquezas ou qualquer outro tipo de ajuda que os jogos modernos nos trazem, ele é diferente, ele confia no jogador em descobrir as coisas sozinhos mesmo que isso signifique morrer milhares de vezes ate aprender um padrão de movimento de um inimigo, não se deixe enganar você vai morrer e vai aprender o quão importante é a habilidade antes de seu equipamentoBonito, Inteligente e brutal essas são as palavras que definem esse ótimo jogo.",LionBrito,http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionBrito,0

(I don't know specificly but they're just terrible)* The game is dead (No one are on the servers)And the very last one... THE DEVS HAVE ♥♥♥♥ING ABANDONED THE GAME!! They took our money and just left.If you are looking for a good dinosaur survival game then just get ARK. So much better in every way.I can not recommend this game under any circumstances.

But then, they decided, lets limit that fun. Warriors cannot sprint without putting their weapon on their backs, for some reason, this was implemented, i am assuming to stop people from sprinting into combat swinging? but that couldn't be it, because that would add so much fun to the game.But, probably the worst decision that was made, was to add an energy bar, i guess it is to stop people from swinging a lot, but that's what people wanted from this game, they wanted that fast paced action packed feeling, only to be greeted with absurdly unrealistic limitations. I want to have to block 15-20 swings in a 10 second fight, i want that thrill, that rush, the feeling one might expect from being a viking. But instead we are given a slow game, that makes it feel like we are all terribly hung over warriors, decades past our prime swinging heavy sticks, losing our breath after just a bare few swings. gone are the days warriors trained to endure i guess.I just feel massively let down by this game, i thought it was going to be what war of the roses almost was before it was drenched in honey, making combat slow and boring. Although, the game might have changed? i haven't really been able to play it to test since a few months after it came out, considering how no one plays the game anymore. Its all a massive shame, i had high hopes, now i guess all i can do is wait for mount and blade 2, and hope they don't destroy that too, by catering to the slow of block.did the designers just not want to do new weapons? power strike was awesome, if a 2nd is made, and they keep the energy bar, lets hope they make it so that it only gets drained by sprinting and power strike, its too short a bar, and recovers too slowly for it to be used for everything.",bigmangina,http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigmangina,0

This game is just jump scares. Jump scares are not horror. The story is a joke too. If you take the time to read the story, its very under whelming. Its also extremly boring even if you do read it. The ending is crap too, leaving much to be desired. While there are cool concepts like the camera, night vision, and look behind mechanic (which is actually the best thing ever) its too hidered by boring gameplay, stupid A.I, and jump scares. If you want a better game, go by Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Its so much better and creepier than this game and has some puzzles. Also there is no point to have The Twins be nude. Its just odd.",76561197963469414,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963469414,0

So do I think the dlc is bad? No,Do I think that it was stupid to release the dlc in this stage of development? Yes",Smiggleton,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiggleton,0

On its own, this isn't an awful fact, but it's an omen of bad things to come. Aside from resolution and brightness options, there are no visual options to tweak. There is no antialiasing and no way to enable it. And frame rate troubles will haunt your every saber swing. It's too bad that so little respect was shown for the platform--and to those that will spend money on this product--because the underlying game is rather good. As Darth Vader's secret apprentice, you slice through grunting Rodians with your glowing lightsaber, go head-to-head with slobbering rancors, and punt jawas into the distance as if they were pigskins.

I've invested 600 hours of my life into this game, yet I am still terrible no matter what class I play. Tf2 has been a great ride. I was late to the game, arriving to steam in early 2015. Obviously, as most people do, I picked up TF2 first. Being a console player at the time, I was amazed at the game being free. I played about 6 hours all at once when I first played, and was addicted. I played like that for 1 whole year. Obsessed. Then suddenly, in late 2015 (I think) Gun Mettle happened. This changed up the game alot, with a bunch of up and downsides, although I loved the new map, Suijin. They CS:GO-ified TF2 a little, although I didn't care, and continued playing the game. The next major update was Tough Break, which in my opinion, wrecked the game. Nevertheless, I kept on playing, having fun on pubs. Pubs. Valve servers. In this very recent update Valve removed Valve servers, and replaced them with casual mode. It isn't very casual though, as it's a big hassle trying to get into a game, and it doesnt let you pick your own game. I like to pick a game with low latency and about 20 people playing. I like the new hud, but casual is trying way too hard to be competitive. Recently I have decided to quit TF2. This is an extremely sad thing for me to do, but I no longer find this game enjoyable. I do not recommend this game to my fellow steam users. Thank you for reading my review on the game Team Fortress 2.",eddiedankmemes,http://steamcommunity.com/id/eddiedankmemes,0

This is what happens 90% per cent of the time to players who don't hack while the cheats can do as they please because they are armed to the teeth. The community in this game is a joke (more like a community of trolls and angry children), which most people just kill you for the hell of it. There is no team work or friendly people to build alliances with in this game and it in the end becomes a battle between you and the hackers/ hacker groups, which you don't stand a chance.

2 people found this review funny,"Posted June 25, 2015.",,291650,3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful,False,"This game is utter Garbage and a complete waste of time, and money.I brought this game because of the hype that it was a classic RPG, which lived up to the fame of past titles like Bolders gate, and Icewind dale series, thinking that it would be great experience just like the other titles that obsidian entertainment had been a apart of in the past. I quickly fould out however that the only thing this game really shares in common with past RPG's is the on-screen layout. The first big problem with this game is that it is full of crappy useless lore in that 80% of the lore in this game, is really unrelated to the storyline, other then reminding you of an ability you already have (Reading souls.) This is a big problem because it actually makes it harder to even understand the plot of the game, or will make you either not care for the plot, and can even make you want to quit the game because it just seems like nonsense even for an RPG. The second problem with this game is the game mechanics itself, in which there is only a slight few differances between classes, but not enough to make them feel unique or stand out in the party, For example, the Rogue, barbarian, fighter, monk, and paladin only have about 8 different abilities that seperate them from each other, the rest of their abilites are commonly shared between all classes in the game. Another example is that you don't need a Rogue to disable a trap, as any class with ""mechanics"" skill can disable traps, and is available to all classes.The third problem with this game is when experiance is earned, in that combat dosn't earn experiance unless you kill a group of creatures for an achivement, like 10/10 monkeys slain. This makes combat useless and really feels like a slap in the face when you spend a few hours slaying a dragon, only to be rewarded with a few ingredients and no exprience points what so ever. The forth problem with this game is the AI, in that your team members will not auto-attack enemies, even when they come running towards your party. Even worst still is that during the end game, enemies won't attack you, but instead just stand on the spot waiting for you to kill them. During my playthrough I watched as the Adra dragon was slain by 4 beetles, 3 spiders and a white fox, while the rest of my geared up party waited on the otherside of the map. I killed the final boss of the game without any of my party losing even 1 hp, thats how bad the AI was.This game honestly felt cheap and very rushed. The story made very little sense, and what did make sense felt very bland and boring. the Areas/levels of the game were nothing new and looked average at best.

I started playing this game a few days ago and it was alright, despite some FPS issues and buggy animations in some official servers. I was planning to give this game a thumbs up, however after the 1.0.1.1 patch its literally impossible for me to join an official server due to the fact that all servers are in the US. Thus, everytime I join I get kicked for high ping (+200) since I play from Oceania region. Thereby, I cannot recommend this game as of now.Here are some improvement suggestions to devs:*Add official servers in Oceania region for South East Asian, New zealand and Australian players*Fix FPS issues on maps like Rooftop and Colosseum due to excessive spawning of zombies and bandits*Enable achievements for single player mode",haoliu98,http://steamcommunity.com/id/haoliu98,0

The basic premise of the game is to get from one area to the next, and the main way to do that is with a cutting laser. You basically carve your way through the terrain and hack up large rocks and ancient ruins, while trying to get your 'pants' (read 'underwear') back from Big. Or were they your Grandpa's pants? Doesn't really matter.This game is fun, and very different. Have a look at the videos in the store and decide if the game is for you.

They are horrible they're not nice at all. We were walking past and they said something in Chinese then said ""You are mudahfahker"" and killed us. We did not do anything to them, Then we found their base and at that point another friend xKoriat joined and helped us. We gave the Chinese's a nickname from what they said ""Chong-Dongers"" this was a funny name.

I really want to recommend dead by daylight to everyone, it is great game to play, but at this time a cannot for some reasons.1) Lobby simulator 2016. if you want the get your surivior perks, you must play in a lobby, this leave you eather getting into a lobby where everyone will bail so they can find there friends or you're the one doing it. i know they where trying to give you the spooky feeling of playing with random people to make it scary, but sometimes you just want people you can trust to play with. Just make a group with friends please.2) Call of duty would be proud. If you want to keep your rank as a survivor, NEVER,AND I MEAN NEVER GET HOOKED. Once you are placed on it, get ready to say bye to that rank point cause your about to have a sleep over with the killer, he will just sit at your feet till you're dead or some random thinks that the killer is afk and trys to save you, getting knocked out cold.3) Now watch me rank, now watch me de-rank. Now this part of my rant personaly makes me rage. The ranking system. Simple, if you want to rank, you need three things. A buddy, good internet connnection and luck, cause if you don't, you're in for a ride. to get your rank up, you must survive or kill. But your rank will go down if you die or not kill people, leave a game, D.C from a game (even if the killer has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet), if the killer or all survivor leave before the end of a game, hell even turning on four out of five generators on and escaping will (yes that did happen), and completing all the task at hand while your team mate sit in the bushes that end up getting you killed while they get escape because they don't care to help you or the camper killer is setting up for the night.This is only a few thing i don't like, but don't take my word on it.

Throw in some middle of the mill voice-acting, cliche' characters and a story not to write home about and you get Deadlight. Also, why the heck can you not kill zombies with your axe? Even after several whacks at a zombie which would've executed it, the thing still gets up and comes for you. What could've been a very atmospheric apocalyptic action side-scroller is ultimately a chore of the game with a bore of a story. Even for the price point, please do yourself a favour and avoid this mediocre piece of garbage.

There doesn't seem to be any real strategy in dealing with stress and so the game becomes a frustrating grind where you feel like you are close to a win but then are forced to retreat... which probably fails... so you take more stress damage.... and when you do retreat the resulting stress kills your favourite guy with a heart attack... The whole thing just felt unfair. I'm all for a challenging game but I expect a strategy I can employ to overcome it, just dumb luck and feeling like everything is against you regardless of skill is not fun.

I hid him in the basement, and let him rest. He couldn't get out. Then the person with the Shotty came down the ladder, and I clobbered her with my hatchet. The other two in the house were un-armed, but I killed them anyway. By the time I had gotten the shotgun, it was 20mins till dawn, and I wasn't getting out in time. He had arrived home that afternoon, but was leathaly wounded and broken. I had one of my guys talk him back into life, and give him some canned food.

So you can customize your killstreak loadout, okay but a lot of them are broken and one killstreak is called the Care Package and it takes 3 kills to get. With only 3 kills you can get a freaking AC-130 and cut up the enemy team. The worst killstreak is the nuke as it instantly ends the match. There's a barragement of overpowered and underpowered weapons, the ACR wrecks all enemies and the M16 might as well not be there. The map design is horrid, offering infinite opportunities for camping. There's also deathstreaks which can increase your health, give you your killer's loadout, etc.Then there's the community; teenagers claiming to have sexual relations with your mother, idiots who tell you to kill yourself because you're the host and the game is laggy without them realizing that the netcode is horrid, people who run around the map quickscoping/trickshotting instead of playing the game, people who intentionally make their loadout overpowered, etc. It's a blitzkrieg of flawed game design and you shouldn't spend your money on it.",itsdandytime,http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsdandytime,0

However in saying this they’ve also taken a lot of elements out, simple elements that make COD… COD! Like care packages, they’ve been completely removed and replaced by “field orders” that only one player in the game can have at a time and the order it almost always really hard to do. The maps are painful and the server response time is real. But the biggest thing is that no one plays it! “0 Potential games found…” and on every game mode.

The AI is woefully terrible, which I guess could be forgiven as they are zombies, however it just feels too easy on hard. I only played the first few levels, but the feel of the game just felt wrong. Like an unfinished game. There needs to be more fun rather than an endless stabbing zombies in the head simulator.If you are a fan of the series and want a Walking Dead experience then I would highly recommend you go and purchase the Telltale games series of The Walking Dead. They are brilliant pieces of storytelling that make you emote, and feel like you are actually making decisions that change the story.

,"Posted October 17, 2015.",,730,No ratings yet,True,"“Counter-Strike: Global Offensive” é um excelente jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa. Quem se lembra do game dos meados dos anos 2000 vai se sentir em casa. É divertido relembrar mapas como Dust, Italy e Train e dá até uma vontade de chamar os amigos para jogar em casa.Mesmo assim, é um jogo que mostra sinais da idade: não foram feitas atualizações nem adicionadas novas mecânicas que justifiquem voltar ao game que, em sua essência, é o mesmo de anos atrás. Vale para quem está com saudades e quer variar um pouco da mesmice de jogar “Call of Duty”.• Pontos Positivos •Mecânica continua atual:Não há como negar: “Counter-Strike” é um jogo extremamente viciante. Mesmo quem se afastou do game - seja pelo motivo que for -, vai se sentir em casa. Afinal, pouco da mecânica foi alterado e o que mudou foi para deixar o game mais realista.Um desses exemplos é quando você usa o telescópio dos rifles de precisão, que deixa a tela um pouco embaçada quando o personagem se move.Mas há novidades também, como a interface de compra, que agora é circular - o que facilita e muito a navegação nas versões para consoles. Novas granadas também aparecem, como o coquetel molotov, que dá liberdade para criar estratégias diferentes. No final das contas, a mecânica de comprar armas em todos os rounds favorece quem joga com cautela e estrategicamente.A versão de PlayStation 3 tem ainda suporte para jogar com teclado e mouse, além do controles de PS Move. Já no X360 não existem tantas variações de controle (nem suporte ao Kinect) e o modo de chat em grupo é desativado – afinal isso poderia ser usado para trapaças, e “Counter-Strike” é um jogo que leva muito a sério a competitividade.Novos modos de jogo“Global Offensive” traz dois modos novos: o Arms Race e o Demolition. Mesmo sendo bem distintos, ambos compartilham de um descontraído espírito arcade e favorecem o confronto direto.Em Arms Race, o jogador ganha novas armas ao matar um adversário e passa por todas até chegar ao momento que se vê forçado a usar apenas a faca. São 26 armas no total e vence quem conseguir usar todas elas com sucesso ou quando o tempo se esgotar.Já em Demolition o esquema é o mesmo das missões de explosão, mas em cenários menores e com mais contato entre os times.  Além disso, o jogador só usa novas armas quando mata alguém do time adversário.Em todo caso, essas novas modalidades garantem um fôlego extra para quem é veterano e diversão imediata para quem ainda engatinha no game de tiro da Valve.Visual bonito""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" é muito bonito. É até estranho dizer isso, tendo em vista que a Source Engine, uma ferramenta de 2004, já não faz gráficos tão elaborados como a CryEngine (de “FarCry 3”) ou a Frostbite 2 (de “Battlefield 3”). Cenários como Aztec ou Italy são bem detalhados e divertidos de serem revisitados.Existem efeitos de luz dinâmica e fumaça volumétrica que enchem os olhos e esse resultado pode ser obtido mesmo em computadores com placas mais populares – leia-se: não muito caras.Por outro lado, é notável a queda de  qualidade gráfica nos consoles, principalmente no PlayStation 3, que mostra texturas mais lavadas e com taxa de atualização em 30 quadros por segundo - uma qualidade bem abaixo do que estamos acostumados a ver em jogos atuais.• Pontos Negativos •Poucas novidadesFaltam bons motivos para justificar o retorno de ""Counter-Strike"". Por mais que bata a saudade de reunir amigos para um 'corujão' em uma LAN House, fica a pergunta: por que jogar ""Global Offensive""?As duas novas modalidades e os mapas inéditos não são motivos suficientes para voltar ao mundo de “Counter-Strike”.  O mais provável é que, a longo prazo, as pessoas continuem jogando o modo clássico de “Counter-Strike” e nos mesmos mapas de sempre (Aztec, Dust, Italy etc.) - e se divertindo como sempre aconteceu nas versões 1.6 e “Source”.A situação é ainda mais complicada para quem joga nos consoles que, além de não poder jogar os mapas criados pela comunidade, ainda corre o risco de ser abandonado pela Valve, como já aconteceu com as versões de “Team Fortress 2” para X360 e PS3.",nene_oficial,http://steamcommunity.com/id/nene_oficial,0

You can drive in and out of the Batcave in free roam, as well as the the enterance for the Batboat and Batwing. I love everything except a couple annoying little things. It is always night and raining. This is exactly how i thought Gotham would look, but it gets a little annoying after a while. LEGO needed to make a daytime option for the game. The flying controls are a little frustrating, but i found myself not flying that much. There aren't a huge amount of characters, but you just have to make do with what you get. Green Lantern was the most dissappointing as you can't make anything with his ring, except for certain points in levels. And once you complete the game, there are some constructs that you can make that stretch all over Gotham. I found this really annoying as when you were driving you would have to doge them as it would sometimes flip your car/bike. One of the most annoying problems was that there were no steam achievements, so once you fully completed the game, there were no steam achevements to do. It sounds like this game is really bad, but i just pointed out the main problems with it, everything else is great.I highly recommend this game.Score: 8.5/10",76561198152535010,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198152535010,0

Your choices don't mattter - the game revels in not giving you any control over what happens, and then blaming you for every character's constant failures. And its frustrating, because the game starts strong with well-written and well-voiced protagonists. But because its using a licensed property, nothing you can do can impact on the world. And that's REALLY frustating when the antagonist is already a cannon character. Apart from that - the game engine is hideous, the dialogue choices feel limited, the writing has new characters feel like cartoonish characatures, and all gameplay is either pressing a direction for movement, repeatedly pressing q then e or walking around for 2 minute spurts.

Also note that i am comparing this to AOE2. Okay so let me start with the plus's of this game.+Better Graphics+Bigger mapsThats just about all i can think of for plus's.When it comes to the minus's i'd like to think i have a fair comparison when looking back to aoe2 and this game. So this games ""RTS"" system is probably the most unqiue and bull ♥♥♥♥ excuse for a game under the genre... The games AI is broken as ♥♥♥♥, the level up system is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and dont even get me started about the varity of teams. A small thing that made AOE2 unique was the randomised team names where in AOE3 it uses actual historyical figures to play as, all of which are terribly voiced over. I can't stress enough that this game is a watered down yet stale game.I cant recommend this AOE game because it hardly even stands up as an AOE.

,Posted March 8.,,335670,2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"With all the hubbub around another great recent sprite-based indie RPG, I keep recommending those that liked that one to try out LISA.It's a post-apocalyptic tale of a father searching for his daughter in a hellscape full of twisted mutants and the worst of humanity that will play at your emotions and expectations, part absurdist, part horrifyingly real.The battle system is unique, with a big emphasis on status effects and dialing in combos like a fighting game. While some of these techniques (anything involving tripping, oil+fire attacks) will turn most battles into a cakewalk, it's offset by the ridiculous brutality of many of the bosses.However, the story and writing is the best part of the game. The creator toes a fine line between absurd, often crude or sardonic humour and extremely serious moments that will have you on the edge of your seat. Many times you will have to choose between two horrible decisions, and the consequences will impact the rest of your game. There are no happy endings in The Painful RPG and the game will always remind you of the awful choices you made.A twisted and groovy soundtrack tops it all off. I am yet to find another game quite like LISA.",holgast,http://steamcommunity.com/id/holgast,0

Unfortunately they have not. The core of the gameplay, attacking and blocking the opposition is still broken to the point that the game is not fun, but provides a frustrating experience.It creates anger every time you play it becuase the game field is not fair. Everything feels slow and clunky becuase all the servers lag so badly. Some are better than others, but in the end, those with the best pings will dominate. It is not uncommon to die 10 times and only get 1 kill becuase the lag is so bad. Your actions on screen are not registered and all you end up doing is getting killed unfairly as hits go through your block. This repeats every match, every game.If Torn Banner actually cared about the game, they would have attempted to fix it after all these years instead of making a DLC for it. I cannot recommed this game to anyone, not even when it is on sale as I feel like I should be entitled to a refund. It is not fun nor challenging. It just provides hours of frustration while taking your money and wasting your time.",76561198031967258,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031967258,0

It has a nonsensical story that is neither as sophisticated as it thinks it is, nor as interesting as it tries to be.  Its music and art assets are frequently recycled throughout the entire game. It currently has barely 2 hours of game content, which is encased in a platform that seeks to draw out the experience over 3-4 hours through the use of confusing level design.Then there's the glitches, like being unable to interact with in-game items that are necessary for you to proceed further, causing you to have to reload your game. The worst part, and perhaps the most insulting thing about Hektor, is that it isn't scary at all. Outlast was scary, Alien Isolation was a stressful and harrowing experience. Hektor? Hektor is a complete disgrace to the horror genre of games. Watch any of the lets-plays that are currently on Youtube. Not a single one of them is enthralling, immersive, or in the least bit frightening. Many claim that the game's atmosphere is intensely creepy, and that they would prefer a game like Hektor to one filled with jump scares. Sure, jump scares alone do not make a horror game. Neither do games that are all about the long drawn out creepy atmospheres that eventually amount to nothing. You can only play so much of Hektor before you feel cheated and violated, like the boy who is strung along by a candy man with all the promises of a sweet future, only to end up in the back of a windowless van. No, there is nothing causing that sound that appears to be made by the wheels of hospital beds rolling across the corridor. Its just one of the many sound assets that the game randomly plays every now and then to build up 'atmosphere'. In fact, I haven't seen a single hospital bed move in this game. How about those creaks and groans and that squeaky violin sound you hear as the background music reaches its crescendo? Yup, just more of the same. Sounds with no force of a credible threat behind them. And do you know why there is no hiding in this game? Because there is no need to - the game is a bloody walking simulator. The only threats in Hektor reside in the creatures that you will encounter in this game, and what a disappointment they are.The developers advertise this game as having a horrific monster that tirelessly pursues you. Yes there is only one monster in the game capable of killing you. But the only times you experience being chased by this presence is halfway through the game when you first come across it, and towards the end when the game artificially ramps up its difficulty level by putting the creature in your path. Beyond those two occasions, you almost never encounter the creature, much less get 'pursued' by it. Additionally, it is difficult to be afraid of a monster that has pathing issues. There was one occasion when the monster ran continuously into a box that was in front of me as it tried to get at me. Besides this monster, the game scatters, with no logical rhyme or reason, half naked deathly pale people around the map. These death-camp prisoner of war lookalikes cannot hurt you physically, but are capable of reducing your character's sanity level if you are near them when they scream. The first time you encounter one of these people is a decently shocking experience, but towards the later part of the game, their presence is at best an irritating encounter as the game uses the same audio asset for their screams, and at worst you might end up laughing in their face, especially when you see their ridiculous transition from person into a reddish spectre. Who are these people-like things? What is that monster that chases you? What is the Hektor program? Who are you? Why are you at the facility? How did you come to develop your psychosis? Why do you guzzle antipsychotic medications like M&Ms? You'd probably have a better chance of getting that information from God than this game. In fact, Hektor hardly explains anything properly. The game conveys its tale singularly through badly written journal or diary entries that are randomly distributed throughout the entire level in a humdrum and erratic manner.  Walk into the intelligence room for the first time, pick up a journal entry. Walk into the intelligence room again at a later time, great there are 2 more journal entries to pick up. What the ♥♥♥♥ is this? Shouldn't the intelligence room be empty now given that I have just explored it earlier? The entire attempt feels so lazy, so half-hearted. It destroys any remaining immersion that one might have in the game up to this point. The main story is simplistic. It is also full of boring cliches. How many times can we pretend to be interested in the stories told by the people who eventually develop the 'crazies', or some aggravated form of 'stockholm' syndrome? Leave that for the bad movies, it is their rightful domain. You are supposed to be making a horror game that scares us, unnerves us, that makes the hairs on our skin stand as we uncover the story bit by bit. And this is the best you can come up with? $14.99 is too much money to spend on this utter filth and garbage. $14.99 is too much money to spend to be insulted by the developers, who think they can masquerade this bad cashgrab as a 'psychological horror game'. The only thing that is horrifying about this game is our ridiculously low expectations when it comes to paying for and hyping garbage like this on Steam. If you enjoyed 'Daylight', which is another horror game with procedurally generated levels, you might enjoy Hektor. They are both equally bad. Another option is to skip both games, and simply watch a let's play from one of the better youtubers out there. It will require a considerable amount of good acting skills on the part of the youtuber to beat some life into this dead dog's body.Otherwise, FASTER FASTER... avoid Hektor.

It is also the most offensive and generally disgusting game I have ever played. It is the personification of isanity and  malice. It was quite simply constructed to be offensive to as many audiences as possible. The beggining of the game shows a child under fear of murder by his own mother. This is followed by the first dungeon, in which isaac needs to use his own tears to fight the monsters within. That sounds bad enough, however throughout the game, more disgusting content is clear. As isaac finds powerups, he attatches them to his body in the most gruesome way possible.  This game has reduced any sense of respect i had for team meat and I would never want to meat this author.

Much like the upcoming 'Shadows of the Past' board game/Pen and Paper RPG hybrid, it uses as its source material; the, well, source material. Sure it's based of the 2011 Reboot comics but thats still the current comics. There are some weird mistakes like refering to the Utroms as Krangs (yest still refering to Krang as Krang, what?) and an off hand mention of the Purple Dragons that seems to imply them as a gang even though they reformed and became a neiborhood watch group (then again, I am behind on my Turtles comics mabye Hun turned them bad again, I dunno). Anyway, there has never really been a GOOD TMNT video game, oh sure none of them have really been TERRIBLE but they are mostly boring, mindless, button mashing, Beat 'em ups. Out of the Shadows was probably the best but is still wasn't that good (and if a game based on the second Paramount movie comes out, I'm not refering to that I'm refering to the 2013 game). How does this one fair? well... It's Platinum so... yeah, you can't really go wrong with platinum. All I have played of their games are Metal Gear Rising, The Legend of Kora and now this and I can say that I may get around to buying Transformers: Devistation (probably not though since I don't really care about Transformers) but I WILL be getting there original IPs if they make their way to Steam. Anyway, definatly get this; classic Platimum gameplay, mimicing the art of Mateus Santoluco (TMNT Issue #5,22-28,33-36,38-40,45-47,50,56-58 and The Secret History of the Foot Clan Mini-Series) and a script by Tom Waltz (Script Writer and Co-Plotter for all 58 and counting issues of the TMNT ongoing), how can you go wrong?Update: Alot of people have been giving this game bad reviews soley based on the 30fps lock and lack of local multiplayer. Those are not legitmet reasons to say a game is bad, 30fps IS the standard, 60 or 90 is a bonus. Yes, the online only multiplayer is a shame but; 1. That, unfortunatly, is the standard now, 2. The game is still good singleplayer.",SenorcThePie,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SenorcThePie,0

Once you finally get past the log in screen you have to deal with the terrible automated resoultion which by the way when you first launch the game you can't change because of the f**king useless tutorial, so if you have an adverage monitor like me you can't see the full screen until you manage to click away the tutorials, get into the menu and change the resoultion. Whats even more annoying is that you can't change the aspect ratio. Personally I play games at 4:3 because it reduces lag and feels like it reduces input lag. Whats even more terrible is that once you get into the game, even with maxed out sensitivity its still horribly low so its incredibly hard to aim. I wasn't able to get into a proper match as apparently there were net works issues. But from what I've managed to strangle out of this game the gameplay seems to be s**t. 3/10 For what I managed to play.",gourmetdeadthings,http://steamcommunity.com/id/gourmetdeadthings,0

I decided to just join a match, 2 games where running, each playing the LOBBY gamemode, with 1 player each and -1 ping, my game froze for an odd minute or so then when i tried to join one of these games i was greeted by a black screen, five minutes later and still nothing, i closed the game and gave it another shot and nothing changed. and third time is not the charm, tried hosting a game and this time i was left to some lovely art and nothing more.This is not a game that should be purchasable, i personally got it in a humble bundle so I'm not too upset, but this game is just nothing, im sure maybe the combat is fairly redeeming, but the game is t incomplete to let you access the combat, and indie multiplayer only games are always a terrible investment and never relaly a good buy, because there is never anybody palying which will make the game unplayable, literally unplayable",PatSWAG,http://steamcommunity.com/id/PatSWAG,0

Maybe the devs will see in the future, but for now don't waste your money on this game until they improve survival.",riletyface,http://steamcommunity.com/id/riletyface,0

,"Posted March 19, 2014.",,91310,No ratings yet,False,"Dead Island whilst promising an interesting game experience unfortunately fails in many areas. A clumsy game movement interface showing a poor console port, jumping his hit or miss, sometimes really far, sometimes short.Enemies that level up with you making levelling up somewhat futile including weapons as you are your enemies are basically keeping pace, I have never come across this before and find it a truly strange idea. Poor visual and game mechanic sync, where certain enemies like thugs reach far more than appearances would indicate and if the visual matched the game mechanic their arms would be dragging along the ground a couple of feet behind them.The idea of extremely weak weapon that wear out at a ridiculous rate and require constant repairs is also pretty annoying, an accepted idea taken way to far.Overall the game comes off as having a rather juvenile sense of humour, making the game more annoying than fun, more of a frustrating struggle than a challenge. A game that you could take years to finish, as you just stop playing rather than putting up with the annoyances and then come back to it months later to continue from the last save before again putting it away prior to finishing it.It's a shame Steam don't offer game refund credits, so you can spend unload games like this and spend it on alternate titles, this game is definitely of money back quality.",76561197989758447,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989758447,0

The main purpose of this online game is to gather provisions, build a base, and defend said base against raids, or you can raid other bases. I have two major problems with it though. 1) the game's servers frequently reset, which can be every week, or more. This results in the base you spent so much time building, which may be days, to be erased. 2) as I mentioned, you can raid bases or be raided by other players. However, you are left vulnerable whilst you are offline. So people can raid your base while you're not there to defend it, and they can steal everything you worked to make, like guns or explosvies. This is really awful as it takes an incredibly long time to research and produce certain items.Some players may find this thrilling or challenging, but I find it frustrating and pushes me away from spending time in the game.

Дайте патронов тогда! Но и тут найн тебе.Так вот стоит ли платить как за дорогой лицензионный диск с фильмом при походе в кинотеатр? Учитывая ещё то что на этот фильм не будет желания сходить ещё раз. Это все конечно решать вам, но ради бога не покупайте сезон пасс сразу, сначала пройдите игру как я и сделал.Почему эта игра испытание для нервов? Ну это потому что её можно описать так - катакомбы с чужим и однообразными андроидами которые знают лишь пару фраз. Да да игру решили удлинить за счёт ужасной карты, тёмных коридоров, и что самое страшное тупиков в виде спрятанной кнопки, или трубы, из-за чего я бегал взад вперёд по 20 раз вплоть до часа, а жизнь то короткая штука что бы таким заниматься.Что касается чужого то его нельзя убить, но можно полюбить, как спросите вы?Ну сначала ты его боишься, но после 20 спаривания с ним, или с ней ты уже привыкаешь к новой партнёрше с которой постоянно целуешься обнимаешься, короче чужая мне уже как супруга которая просто ходит по дому что бы позвать на десерт, особенно настырная она была в больничке, казалось что она контролирует сразу и шахты и коридоры и шкафчики.Сюжет слабый увы, точнее нечего даже и не придумали все по кусочку с фильмов взяли, и этих сюжетных моментов в игре моя чужая наслюнявила так что кабзец.На низком уровне сложности чужая моя в душе глупая блондинка, но все так же опасна, а на высоком уровне ну вообщем лучше не бздеть а то учует найдёт, и наругает :)Самый тяжёлый вопрос в этом обзоре для меня это поставить палец вверх или вниз.1.Скажем хорошая графика палец вверх.2.Хорошая звуковая атмосфера палец вверх.3.Хорошая оптимизация палец вверх.4.Красивая чужая палец вверх.Теперь о другой стороне медали.1. Однотипный неинтересный геймплей без каких либо прокачек оружия, и возможности перепрохождений игры для дальнейшей прокачки и развития геймплея в будущем, из-за всего этого игра автоматом становится на один раз.Все это явно палец вниз.2.Слабый главный герой игры, и тут дело даже не в том что он слабый на фоне её мамочки, тут он просто слабый по всем параметрам, + эмоций мало в схватках. Это палец вниз.3. Игру сделали так что бы вы умирали в поисках чего-то что не доступно ясно как найти из-за ужасной карты, и отсутствия подсказок, или же просто тупо спрячут кнопку или проход в трубу что бы вы подольше поиграли.Это жирный палец вниз.4.Игра очень неинтересная из-за слабой атмосферы нахождения в космосе, дед спейс подсказал, из-за голимой боевой системы, банального до немогу сюжета который никак с новой стороны не откроется, а половину игры вы вообще будете бегать за аптечкой для барби которая потом итак скукарекается, это не простительно столько нудятины в сюжете. Ещё неинтересной игру делает постоянный секс с чужой которую саму все никак не получается удовлетворить, как только появляется огонь она сразу спрыгивает :(Все это делает игру банально неинтересной к прохождению.И Это палец вниз.5. Игра дорого стоит учитывая что она на один, пускай для ярых фанатов за*дротов на два раза.Но для нормального геймера пройти раз игру в год это значит что игра все же одноразовая, как я уже писал как в кино сходить, а кино должно быть доступным особенно если сюжет хромает...Итого пальцев вниз больше значит поставлю палец вниз, но не из-за злобы за что-то, хотя была и злоба на разработчиков во время игры, но ставлю скорее для того что бы разработчики по возможности читали, и делали игры ещё хорошими как игры, а не только как повесть, или симулятор надувного Кена для Чужой.",SirexPower,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirexPower,0
4 people found this review funny,Posted January 20.,,262060,4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful,True,"Played the beta and haven't played full release yet, so review is based on that.The game in a nutshell- hire mercenaries of many classes. Create a party of 4 to descend into some dark and horrific dungeon. Use the many abilities of the various classes to defeat your foes, collect treasure. Cry when your favourite hero dies. Use loots to upgrade town, improve heroes and delve in again.The different classes for heroes mean there is lots of different ways to create a party. Some classes are about straight up damage. Others are better at using damage over time effects (lower damage, but they stack AND bypass defences, but can be resisted). Some classes used a ""mark"" mechanic, marking an enemy and doing no damage, but in turn allowing powerful abilities or bonus damage on that enemy. There are CC based classes too. However the evil that dwells in the dark is merciless. You will lose heroes. Some will go crazy and wander off. Others can have so many negative traits as to be unusable.Combat is part RNG, part skill and part risk-vs-reward. Like your party is low on health, the next room is your last and it's a treasure room. You could forfeit the completion bonus but keep your heroes. Or you could fight the monsters and pray for a win. Just like in life though, sometimes things just don't go your way. Sometimes everything goes your way, but when things go bad, you(r heroes) hurt.Not only that but throughout the dungeon morale is slowly chipped away. Bad news if it drops too much, a masochistic hero that refuses a heal could well spell the end of your expedition.Be well friend, and come prepared to face the evil that lurks in the Darkest Darkness.",76561197992681922,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992681922,0

You will die and you will die a lot!!! Unlike Tiny Barbarian this game will test your skills at every corner, it has a steep learning curve that will punish you at every turn.  How you proceed in Volgarr is to die and learn from your mistakes.  Your health is made up by items that you collect along the way, for example your shield and helemt each add an additional Health Point to your armour, each time you get Hit you lose an item until you finally die. Controls are a bit limited and there are no checkpoints along the way.Being such a hard game makes every level you complete feel like such a mammoth victory, having mastered all the enemys, traps and string them together to safley get you through a level actually gives you a sense of accomplishment.  It has the feel of a Money hungry arcade game forcing you to enter more coins and learn the game so that you can progress.

But that I mean, without the Music turned up full blast, you notice how bland and darkly contrasted the game itself is, but that's not the point, right?The game is actually scary. I played through this not wearing pants and by the time I was done I was wishing that I had some pants to put on to crap in so I had a reason to not be wearing pants. I lasted no longer than 20 minutes, of which about 12 was gameplay. I decided to uninstall it on the basis that my neighbours might file a noise complaint due to my girlish squeals. Not a very manly look for a manly man like myself.I'd recommend this game as a gift for people you wish pain and suffering on. Unless you are someone who seeks out jumpscare games I wouldnt recommend it. It's not much in the department of an environmental-horror game like that of games like Resident Evil or the Alien horror game as this seems to rely more on reactive frights as opposed to engaging the player with deep story elements allow the player to creat their own nightmare out of the fear they have created themself.I cant really judge it though, I didnt really las tmore than 10 minutes.",SucoVidya,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SucoVidya,0

Like i try to choose this monster but the game decide for itself and change the monster i want(the same goes with hunter). Another one when player quit or afk an A.I will replace them(the thing is A.I is really dumb last time i check) and when player quit, no player will join the game to replace it. The last one is the most annoying despite the 1st, like when you found some buddy in your match, the round end, the game switch to new game which will force me to leave the game and auto finding new player.

Not including how insane the campaign gets after that. If you even focus on the town at all you will need to push through the soggy later campaign to get those little triforces to do anything in the game. The situations you get to do is so lame and even doing the right thing or finding a clever way to solve it does nothing but show a +1 for something and you get no satisfaction out of it, making it a waste of time.  Getting stuck in the campaign with no way to progress or get items because you sunk your triforces into the damn farm means your stuck having to pray you dont find yourself stuck without any combos or switch's and believe me it happens. I can't believe you cant BUY triforces for this $15 game because it reminds me of a bad Candy Crush ripoff with a new twist that makes you want to hurl. Will I play it again? Yes, because this ♥♥♥♥ is addicting like heroin, but in the bad way that makes you curl up in a ball and cry about how pathetic you are for continuing something that hurts you so internally. In other words, if you like poopy games that will have gnaw at your brain until you play it again by all means, let's shoot up together.",Smeegan,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smeegan,0

CS:GO is the most refined one of them all, yet it has the absolute WORST match making by FAR. A few examples:-Cooldowns are ♥♥♥♥ed. Fullstop. Further detail will get me banned (Evidence of how bad)-The match making itself should start easy then go hard. If you just throw it in randomly, you're not getting a very accurate result of how things work. This is how other games such as SC2 work, they throw you at easier players first. They don't go from rank 0 to rank 20, but they go ""easy""ish, (say, 0-5), ""medium"" (5-15) and ""hard"" (15-20) to see how you fare. I think valve could learn quite a bit from Blizzard in this aspect.-Another thing is how vague the game is to new players. There is no tutorial at all. The shooting range is a joke and The War Owl is the only help, but he starts off in the middle and at the top, with very little info for starters. Usually i'd take an essay approach and start from the middle, but that simply isn't possible in video games.-Lastly...The community.Period.TL;DR:This GAME is for me, the PLAYERS are not.Overall, this game is well polished, very highly thought out and the pinnacle of competitive gaming.Its community is the absolute worst.

,"Posted December 2, 2015.",,282440,No ratings yet,False,Buyer beware: When this game was moved to steam I'd just renewed my subscription 2 months prior - they refuse to offer even a pro-rated refund despite not providing the remaining 10 months of service which I'd paid for. In addition to this all stats were wiped. A move to steam like this would have been in the works for at least 2 months - so essentially my money was taken without any intention of providing the full duration of the service.In addition to this they have failed to provide a copy of the Terms of Use which I've requested despite this being the grounds for them refusing the refund.It's worth noting that when I say them I am not talking about Steam I am talking about Quake live/ID software/Bethesda (whomever manages their support/billing)Overall it's essentially Quake 3 online - it's fun if you can get a server that's actually got some people in it.

I make a lobby and imediatly rank 1s and 5s join becuase evan though this game has a rank system, it doesnt do ♥♥♥♥. The game runs on player to player connection based on the host, the host is always the killer, and because i live in a poor internet area of Australia isnt good, so 2 people disconect from the game imediatly, which makes it less fun for me and probably the 2 other people. The last 2 people are rank 1s and they both have a skill which COMPLETLY destroys the trappers class, so by the time they do there 1st generator, I only have 1 bear trap left out of the 12 i started with. ""play a different killer"" some people are probably saying, but the only other 2 killers in the game dont suit my kind of play style.My only options to play the game now are play as a laggy survivor because of said internet location, evan though i dont really like survivors, or dont play the game.

,"Posted February 23, 2015.",Last edited June 16.,227940,No ratings yet,False,"The information in this review is outdated due to several major updates to the game.For me this game started off as a great WWII fps with its fast paced gamemodes and variety of weapons. H&G seemed a promising game, during the first few updates. However, the update that revamped the leveling system killed the game for me. This update completely reworked the amount point required for each rank and also poorly scaled the amount earned in battle. It seemed the game wanted me to be heavily reliant on its 'Pay2Win' system which involved spending lots to gain little progress.Though I disapprove of its scheme to make money, I like how the idea for WWII fps has been conveyed through this game. I still recommend this game as it is still only early access and the many flaws it still has can be ironed out, as there is still time until Reto-Moto finally release it. To the digression of those willing to download, be wary of the game's performance, I run decent specs and it is still laggy as hell. Also keep track of server maintenance as it can get annoying.10/10 - IGN, ""Would flip a tank again.""",crossfire3240,http://steamcommunity.com/id/crossfire3240,0

Estan divididos en tres tipos de mercenarios, los mercenarios de ataque (Scout, Soldier, Pyro), los de defensa (Demoman, Heavy, Ingeniero) y por ultimo estan los mercenarios de asistencia (Medic, Sniper, Spy).Pero para mi lo mejor del juego, es que puedes conseguir sombreros (hats) y bestir tus clases/mercenarios a tu gusto!!¡¡Lo recomiendo!!",Dante1899,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dante1899,0

In a sense this game is heavily story driven which is explored through the use of cutscenes. The cutscenes are however affected by your decisions. Your decisions follow the traditional interactive game :you point and click and your decisions affect outcomes in the game ( to some extent) However, what's unique about this game is that it gives the player the choice of rewinding time to re-choose between your options with the knowledge of the outcome of the previously chosen decision.+beautiful visuals+fitting sountrack which complements visuals+unique idea+something newHowever, this game as aforementioned is very story driven.

The game developers have just basically released Assault Squad but slapped a 2 on the side of it, as well as this they add the original games missions in to make up for the lack of content. Still same game engine, no graphical improvement, if there is I cannot tell. Nothing real exciting as a whole. And to make the game ""better"" they start releasing ""DLCs"" such as Iron Fist [Tank Combat] which ads 2-3 missions in which all it does is lock your camera view, and Airborne [Self Explanitory] in which the almost same thing occurs, a small hand full of missions is released, as well as ""bots"" bearly functional AI which should've been in the base game not labled as DLC and getting people to pay for it just for extra money. The only semi-decent thing this game even has is mod support, some of the mods are better than the base game itself, and are even free.To me this game is unplayable without mods.And do yourself a favour, if you already have Assault Sqaud, don't get this game, but if you don't mind numerous bugs, crashing multiplayer, underwhelming graphics and single player campaigns, DLCs aimed to make you pay MORE money to get features which should've been in the base game and a overall disappointing game for any REAL strategist out there.

This game is almost unplayable for me, sure the campaign is alright, works but continuously glitches for me and bodies get stuck in weird positions, maybe that's just my computer but I have a high end laptop and had to set the game to the lowest settings. Multiplayer is a whole different thing, however still very disappointing. I played the co-op exo survival mode and died every within 2 rounds because the game would lag, I was in my own private server, lowest settings once again. This game uses up to 40% of my CPU and that is crazy, slowing my computer down a fair bit. Anyway, whenever I try to play online at any given time, it takes a while to find a game (because no one seems to be playing it either), and then once a game is found it will load and just before it goes into the level, the game crashes.0.1/10 would play again in a decade and then remember it was crap.

Hackers run the game and nexon pretends that they care. If you did pay money for this game and want to buy end game equipment well guess what? nexon says that is illegal your only allowed to carry 10b at one time and end game equipments can be worth 100b+ making scams easier.

Although it includes characters from different franchises you have to pay £3.99 for the privilage of owning that character - such as GI Joe and Cobra which is a real kick in the teeth!

Comparing this to ETS2, I would say that this game has several improvements in terms of gameplay. One of which is the new trailer parking options. I find it very pleasing to be able to choose how you would like to park the trailer.The trucks themselves are quite different from the trucks in ETS. The trucks in this game have long bonnets, and I find it rather difficult to turn since I am used to the bonnet-less European trucks from ETS.Moving on to the map. The map in this game is still small compared to the map in ETS2. Currently, the game only has 2 states in its map.Overall, however, I think that this game is very enjoyable to play, and I find it relaxing to play this game, especially while listening to music.",thisrandomguy,http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisrandomguy,0

,Posted March 28.,Last edited March 28.,225840,No ratings yet,False,"Better late than never? This is a very old mod for Half-Life 1 which has now been released on Steam. I don't know why they bothered because it has not got Steam workshop and is very old now. The game defaults to a 4:3 640x480 resolution and you must manually change the video setting to Widescreen mode and then select your desired resolution. The game freezes on map load for about 30 seconds before you can play, if you click the mouse during this time it will crash to desktop.The maps autodownload on connection in traditional Half-Life fashion but it seems the developers have removed the rate limit of 2.5KB/s for server transfers as they download quite quickly now. Once the map has downloaded you will notice all of the textures are missing and you are running around a black and pink checkerboard map. Once again, no Steam workshop so you must manually hunt out the map and download it off the internet then extract it to your game folder and pray that the server hasn't changed maps by the time you go through this troublesome proceedure.The maps are seemingly designed for singleplayer as on a 6 player server it gets really messy with tons of people getting stuck in doorways/hallways as they are too narrow and you can't walk through other players. For whatever reason the players are actually objects that block you and make it a major pain to navigate the maps.Missing basic functionality such as changing your FOV from the options menu. You must go into console and write in default_fov ## to set your fov. The game doesn't save this settings between launches so you must manually go into your game folder and edit your autoexec.cfg in notepad just to change your FOV.This game is definitely showing its age and the developers don't seem to update it anymore as it missing a ton of basic features for a modern game. I have no idea why they finally decided to put it on Steam since it is far past it's prime.Would I recommend this game in 2001? Yes. Would I recommend this game in 2016? No. They should stop messing around and get sven co-op 2 out on the source engine.",agret,http://steamcommunity.com/id/agret,0

Então faltando um mês pro lançamento do capítulo 5 eu vi no youtube ( até em um canal que não conhecia, EletronicDesireGE ) achei a historia do jogo muito interessante e fiquei curioso para saber a conclusão. Decidi então comprá-lo e posso dizer que não me arrependo nem um pouco, nunca um jogo mexeu tanto comigo como LIS e olha que já joguei vários jogos incríveis com enredos fantásticos ( a saga Metal Gear por exemplo é um dos melhores jogos que já joguei em toda a minha vida ). Já me emocionei várias vezes jogando alguns jogos, mas nunca cheguei ao ponto de chorar ( eu diria que até muito no capítulo 5 ) como foi em Life Is Strange. Enfim, vamos aos finalmentes.História - 10 ( Já falei praticamente tudo anteriormente ; Não vou falar sobre o enredo mas é o ponto forte do jogo. De início parece ser aqueles dramas de adolescentes mas garanto que não e é muito mais profundo ).Gráficos - 9 ( ou 10, meu PC não é dos melhores então joguei tudo no médio ).Trilha sonora - 10 ( as músicas simplesmente se encaixaram perfeitamente em todos os momentos do jogo mesmo nem todas sendo originais ) .Gameplay - 10 ( apesar de bem simples responde bem aos comandos e não deixa a desejar, mas nem todos gostam desse estilo mais ""parado"", já eu não tive problemas nem com bugs graves e comprometedores apenas alguns objetos flutuando ).Personagens - 10 ( todos são muito carismáticos e memoráveis com personalidades bem diferentes e legais, as vozes também não deixam a desejar e tudo saiu perfeito ).Como disse anteriormente LIS mexeu muito comigo e recomendo a todos que gostam de uma ótima historia, pode ser ruim para os que não entendem em inglês ( não entendo 100 % támbem ) mas para isso tem a tradução nos sites DivinityPT e Casal Bits que fizeram um trabalho muito bom com poucos erros que não comprometem no entendimento do game.Gostaria de encerrar essa análise parabenizando o incrível trabalho ( da Square Enix também ) que a DONTNOD Entertainment fez com o jogo e espero que essa seja a primeira de várias obras de artes que eles possam fazer pois virei um fã do game e irei recomendar a todos, se tornou um dos melhores games que já joguei ( após o término do cap. 4 fiquei uns dias pensativo e quando terminei o jogo fiquei uns 5 dias com uma sensação esquisita, como se fosse tristeza ) e que me fez pensar muito sobre a vida, sobre tudo. Obrigado por essa incrível experiência e pela tristeza que vai permanecer por um tempo após ter concluído o jogo.Desculpe aos erros de português e por repetir varias palavras muitas vezes.",kydmar,http://steamcommunity.com/id/kydmar,0

,"Posted August 4, 2013.",Last edited January 11.,72850,No ratings yet,True,"Creo, para mi gusto, que no puedo criticarle nada a BETHESDA, para mi uno de sus mejores juegos, aunque en el juego hay algunos bugs son facilmente resolvibles, pienso que es un juego muy bien hecho, llenos de aventuras y batallas por librar... Lo que me encanta es que es un juego muy libre, no es necesario seguir un orden y nunca termina ya que es un gran mundo por explorar. Es un videojuego de rol de acción del tipo mundo abierto desarrollado por Bethesda Game Studios y publicado por Bethesda Softworks. Es la quinta entrega de videojuegos de acción y fantasía de la serie The Elder Scrolls y es posterior a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion y predecesor de The Elder Scrolls Online. Skyrim salió a la venta el 11 de noviembre de 2011 para las plataformas: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 y PlayStation 3. El 4 de junio de 2013 fueron lanzados al mercado tres complementos descargables: Dawnguard, Hearthfire y Dragonborn.La historia de Skyrim se centra en los esfuerzos del personaje del jugador para derrotar a Alduin, un dragón que, según la profecía, destruirá el mundo. La trama está fechada doscientos años después de los sucesos de Oblivion y tiene lugar en la provincia ficticia de Skyrim. En el transcurso de la partida, el jugador completa misiones y hace evolucionar a su personaje gracias al mejoramiento de sus habilidades. A diferencia de los juegos anteriores de Elder Scrolls, en Skyrim no se requiere que el usuario seleccione un tipo de personaje al inicio del juego, resolviendo así el problema que el equipo de desarrolladores veía desde de versiones anteriores: la necesidad de tener que forzar al usuario a un estilo rígido de juego. Skyrim continúa con la tradición de mundo abierto al permitir que el jugador viaje a cualquier parte del mapa del juego en cualquier momento y postponer indefinidamente u omitir parcial o totalmente la historia principal.Aunque no es una secuela directa de los anteriores juegos de Elder Scrolls, durante su construcción fue considerado como un sucesor de la filosofía de Oblivion y de Fallout 3 de 2008. El equipo de desarrolladores optó por un mundo de juego más diverso y único de lo que fue la comarca ficticia de Cyrodiil en Oblivion, los cuales fueron considerados menos interesantes por su director y productor ejecutivo Todd Howard, en comparación con Skyrim. Durante el estreno, recibió buenas críticas por sus cambios, sobre todo en lo tocante al sistema de desarrollo de los personajes, gracias a la experiencia ganada durante el desarrollo de las entregas anteriores de Elder Scrolls. No obstante, también recibió críticas negativas en cuanto a la pobreza del acabado en los detalles de los personajes y a los escuetos movimiento durante un combate cuerpo a cuerpo. El juego fue desarrollado utilizando un motor de creación elaborado por Bethesda Softworks específicamente para este juego. Durante la primera semana de su lanzamiento se enviaron a los minoristas más de siete millones de copias y ha vendido más de 20 millones de copias para las tres plataformas.",pabloagecrash,http://steamcommunity.com/id/pabloagecrash,0

Here's a few hours of gameplay. Don't want to be said evil raider boss? Kill all the raider gang leaders and later ask yourself, ""...what now?"". Seriously though, if you want to stay the goodie two-shoes you are and kill the gang leaders, that's as far as this DLC will take you. Often at times, I felt that I was forced to be evil to be able to experience more of the DLC. While fun, it fell short. No replayability on the DLC because of the issue above.

Then theres the weapon skin franchise, which is basically encouraging kids to gamble which is quite sad. The amount of money you can sink into silly gun paint is ridiculous. I spent less than 5 bucks on about 10 different weapon skins with Stat-trak, instead of paying $2.50 for potential crap, so why bother buying keys and cases at all?

GET IT, wait for a sale if you must, I feel like this should be a game played by everyone at least once. It will really show the horrors and mistakes that war brings. Couple flaws with it obviously, such as replayability, personally, I like to set myself challenges now I know the grips of this game, whenever I feel like playing it, I think of something to do, could be boring for some but I still find the game playable. Like my most recent 'challenge' was to stay inside for as long as I could, just buying and selling materials. Obviously didn't last very long as traders come in a blue moon, but it was still interesting to watch food/water/supplies begin to dwindle and the reactions I would give when traders eventually did show up. [Then when they had nothing I needed]As the trailer says, there are things I've done in this game I'm not proud of and would like to think that it's only a game that brings out such a side that steals from elderly because I needed food so badly..

,"Posted July 31, 2014.",,280740,No ratings yet,True,"(Warning, this review contains spoilers of the game)Ok, this mod is brilliant. Whoever thought of this is genius. The game mechanics of Portal are changed, but nonetheless still have the same feel to it and, although confusing at first, you get used to them.The only things that really sucks about this game are three things.1. There's this part where you have to deactivate some machines and stuff, you have to go on an insane track of jumping and speeding and everything, except my instincts told me to go to this little square in the wall, but when it said to skip the section ahead, I didn't read it properly and jumped it to it, and the worst part is that it doesnt even skip it, it plays someone playing it which was REALLY lame. I was really disappointed and I didn't want to play through the whole chapter again for that one bit.2. Like Portal, almost no replay value.3. The ending of the game is just really bad. This new personality core called Nigel (who is likeable and funny) has been hinted as evil and wants to kill you towards the end of the game. But the ending is just a copy and paste of the original Portal. You're on a platform, descending into fire and, because your paint gun was deactivated, there was no way to avoid it. The game even points out the loophole of you not needing to die, and the last thing you hear is just Nigel describing the rising temperature and then the credits roll. This left a really bad taste in my mouth and it just felt the same but worse, because at least in Portal there's a lot more even after you think the inevitable. That really sucked and I didn't like the ending really. And there's not even really any end in sight of the game, it just sort of ends.But overall, this game is worth the money. It's got a community workshop, which is pretty cool granting lots of possibilites. If you're a fan of Portal 2 you'll like this game.Pros:-Great mechanics-Great gameplay-Good voice actingCons:-Ending isn't up to par with the rest of the game-No replay value really-No real easter eggs of sorts8/10",DarkTitan9174,http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkTitan9174,0

PLEASE FIX THIS. I'LL BE PATIENT. Now back to the review....Loved playing this game. When I bought this game it had a discount I was so interested in it because it was fun, After my first 2 hours of playing it and a few minutes, I kept experiencing game crashes on this game when I choose a character skin or when I'm playing it. After it crashes, the screen becomes black, then it just said said ""Video Device Removed Or Rest"" I saw some forums about this and some other people complaining why is this happening..... StIll the creator of this game still isn't informed or maybe informed about this but not doing anything to fix it, or maybe it's taking too long to fix, some people might just get mad and quit this fun game, Please ""CREATOR"" or ""COMPANY"" of this game, please fix this immediately or it might just become its downfall.

,"Posted March 7, 2015.",,262060,No ratings yet,True,Darkest Dungeon is a game with alot of unique factors that must be considered to do well. It has a variety of class options and trinkets to suit playstyles to fit a wide range of players. The game does however rely heavily on random number generations which can be slightly annoying if the rolls are not in your favour but this adds to the randomness of the game where your entire estate could collapse from one mission. It is a good early acesss game and i would strongy recommend picking this up.,76561198068984689,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068984689,0

They pretty much glide around and it is impossible to hit them.Secondly, this game's quests are boring and the whole storyline isn't that good. The conversations are relatively interesting but with no voice acting throughout every single paragraph it's as boring as reading a dictionary and I tend to lose interest in what the hell they are saying anyway.And finally, the combat is terrible. The classes are unoriginal and the fact you can note headshot with a laser shooting sniper rifle is stupid, the medic can't take on anyone in a fight so it's hard to even begin to do a story quest. The heavy is way too easy and you only need to hold down the left mouse button and everything dies in front of you. And the mechanic never works well as the enemies always attack behind what you've built no matter how much time you spend carefully setting up your buildings.When I first played this game I thought it was ok. But after playing it on and off for over a year now I can now truly say DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It is a complete waste of time and will only cause you anger, frustration and make you waste your time.",Durbles,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Durbles,0

Long story short, I had to force-close it and restart my computer. I felt a little angry at the game for having to shut-down and wait for everything to reload.Around a week later, when I was looking through my steam library for games to play, I found this game again. Remembering my last encounter, I decided to give it a shot anyway, and if the game turned out to be bad, I thought to myself, then I could at least enjoy bashing it for sucking in addition to what it did to my computer. So I started it up, and played it some......It became my favourite game of all time.Seriously, there is not one element of this game which I can't point to as an example of fantastic game design.",76561198054544978,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054544978,0

The game itself has endless things you can do I promise you won't get bored. The one downside to this game that dissapointed me was the sea battles. The sea battles are boring and really hard and complicated to understand otherwise apart from that the game has generally all of the qualities you want in game.

2 people found this review funny,Posted July 26.,,34330,2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful,False,"Overall, the game is great. However, the developers seem to have forgotten about the game soon after the release. Glitches and bugs reported just after the release haven't been fixed yet and will not be. Furthermore, the game in multiplayer co-op mode is painful to play because every once in a while there is some glitch corrupting the saves (probably a desync between host and a second player) - a problem that hasn't been addressed from the day one. Shame really,  the game is great in single player but if you wish to play the campaign with your friend you may have a hard time with reloading save from 20 turns before in order to fix an issue. BTW: for some reason reviewing the DLC - Fall of the Samurai is unfeasible, and one thing worth noting is that the base game is much less glitchy and buggy as the expansion is.",end978,http://steamcommunity.com/id/end978,0

(note, includes African Kingdoms and Forgotten campaigns).The artwork put into the structurse in African Kingdoms is truly a sight to behold... but that's really all the praise I have for it.Based on Age of Kings- a game that sadly isn't as fun as I remembered; here are the reasons I hate this game. It's extremely buggy and prone to crashes. The interface and AI is shamefully bad  and the gameplay is really quite boring and annoying. Expect units (yours and enemy alike) to get confused by simple orders and easily distracted from attacking an enemy unit to instead focus on a harmless nearby building or to put together a (pointless) formation.Worst of all are the campaigns. 90% are escort missions with hardly any base-building parts (the whole point of Age of Empires games) at all. Unlike other RTSs, AOK's combat dynamics are terrible. So you sit bored out of your mind as you guide your clumsy squad around an obstacle course where every ""combat"" situation involves your squad slowly chipping away at an enemy until they (eventually) win.",76561197982685987,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982685987,0
,"Posted January 25, 2014.","Last edited January 25, 2014.",22370,No ratings yet,False,"This game is outright awful. Its major problem is that it is purely an RPG, merely with a FPS perspective (and while RPGs typically boil down to stat designation to compensate for not having any gameplay- a FPS game has no excuse, especially when other FPS like FarCry 3 mix RPG elements perfectly fine). -Interface is clumsy-Skills system is awful- instead of simply enhancing your proficiency or giving you new, handy abilities (like FC3), it simply unlocks arbitrary ""XX minimum skill level required before you are allowed to do this task"" restrictions. And the only way to level up is to hunt down hundreds of enemies, it seems. Also, you get very poor information as to what leveling up otherwise does for you-Weapons are clumsy and weak. A fake 'ironsights' mechanic doesn't help.-Enemies are boring and scarce-Exploration is a chore as everything is so far apart with no faster way of travelling to new areas than walking slowly to them-You want to avoid collecting items as they make you heavier, and you're not allowed to fast-travel for some reason, forcing you to open up your options menu and manually take out dozens of items until your weight gets back into the green-Lots of bugs and glitches- game crashed a few times, and that part where the bad guy shoots the sheriff? Apparently I was supposed to sit back and watch, as punching him causes the sheriff to shoot me instead, ignoring the other guy.-Tutorials are obscene- typically FPSs presume you already know how to walk and hit the 'e' key, but presume you don't know the more advanced mechanics like how 'stealing' works, Karma works, is there a consequence for shooting drones or picking up too many objects, how radiation poisoning works. Not this game, instead it spends 30 or so minutes dragging us through the obvious mechanics, and expects the player to figure the rest for themselves.I don't recommend even playing it. I wish I actually didn't.",76561197982685987,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982685987,0

I've got an AMD R9 270 which can play the game on ultra, although the FPS lag was horrible.

,Posted August 23.,,394510,No ratings yet,True,"Um game simplesmente incrível, em perspectiva isométrica, o game entrega uma experiência muito divertida, mas isso já era esperado basta observar que o game foi feito nos moldes do Magika, parabéns para o studio que conseguiu criar um novo jogo com base em um anterior sem ser um mero ctrl + c, ctrl + v. Singleplayer: Bem como todo game sem um modo história, jogar sozinho e mesmo enjoativo no longo prazo, mas e muito bom para jogar enquanto espera outro download terminar. Multiplayer: A zoeira não tem limites, primeiro pelo coop local de 4 player, a mecânica de todos os players estarem na mesma tela, é perfeita pois faz com que os jogadores trabalhem em equipe, e isso para mim foi o ponto forte do game, pois um game com conteúdo PVE forte, não deve ser só desafiador coisa que ele é, mas também divertido e dar risadas quando perder. DLC's: Recomendo 2 para quem não quer comprar todos, o Ranger Pack e o Support Pack, irão facilitar muito, o ranger por causa do UAV que scaneia amostras (ótimo para fazer um farmzinho), e o Support por causa do Drone de cura e a Carbine laser que se você controlar o aquecimento e praticamente infinita.

Boy was I wrong The controls in the game were clunky and at time unresponsive. I understand that this game is early in its life but come on not including sound when riding the bike! that is something that should have been added in a beta at least. I didn't play the game enough to get a feel for the store or all the levels but that isn't going to change the review as these can't change the game core physics unless the different bikes change how you ride(only would change it a bit).  If you want to ride a MTB start small this game is doing it no justice go out to your local trail have some fun with some friends no matter your ability there is something for you to do. I may take another look at this game again in the future if they do a physics overhaul but until then im keeping the money that I refunded from this game and spending it hopefully on something better (can't stuff up two times in a row ;)  )   TL;DR : Core of game didn't work as expected, got refund.

The way to get new aircraft from the little shitboxes you get at the start of the game is to start researching them earning research points from ingame, don't worry your little WWI biplane wont be flying with end WWII jets as the aircraft are split up into sections where you are only fighting planes that you will be able to take down, this system can be wrong at times where you are flying with your starter biplane aginst planes that are at the end of that teir. The downside to this game is that at the start you are flying to the center of the map to take down the ground units during this time i recomend holding your thrust key with some weight and go get somethingk to eat/drink.

Os gráficos também são ótimos, então eu recomendo pra qualquer pessoa esse jogo.Um jogo onde suas escolhas importam, e alteram o final. Você pode ser um altruísta e tentar salvar as pessoas, você pode ser um sobrevivente que tenta apenas ficar vivo (não importa como), ou pode ser os dois. Cada um desses caminhos vai determinar o final do jogo.O elemento de terror nesse game foi utilizado de forma inteligente, tem horas que você tem medo de virar de costas, tem horas que você ouve barulhos e fica com receio de ir checar. Pode parecer besteira, mas eu joguei esse jogo de madrugada e tinham momentos em que eu realmente fiquei apavorado sjdfksl~sdk~lkA história é contada através dos Diários de Áudio, que são os poucos coletáveis existentes no jogo.

Also the map system is horrid by todays standard, but maybe I'm just being a wuss expecting it to actually show a route to where I put a waypoint but it saves having to keep checking the map which doesn't pause the game.Other than that the engine is pretty good (apart from previous stated bugs/glitches that have occured) the fact that you can change out to almost any character to keep your health up (drugs for keeping it up in the field) and designate where and what buildings you want in your base aswell as WHERE the base is, and set up outposts. Driving is rather easy but I hate hatchbacks, too weak.

,"Posted July 19, 2014.",,304930,No ratings yet,True,"Joguei pouco enquanto estava na Steam, por conta do erro no servidor. No entanto joguei antes de publicarem, quando havia como jogar se registrando no site.Bem, o jogo é bom. Sua 'economia' nos gráficos não fazem o jogo ser ruim. Apesar de está em ""Acesso Antecipado"" o jogo não possui grandes bugs, no entanto, em alguns momentos o jogo parece um ""Walking Simulator"", já que o mapa mesmo sendo pequeno, faz você ficar andando muito tempo até chegar em alguma base/cidade para pegar os itens. Mas, como existem veiculos (que precisam de reparos e combustivel), é o melhor jeito de se locomover.Uma coisa também que é 'ruim' é o número de pessoas no servidor, que até onde ví só suportam até 12 pessoas, e mesmo assim muitos servers contam com apenas 8 slots. O jogo também possui um sistema de construção, mas que não sei como funciona ainda. E tem outra, o jogo tem vários tipos de munições e magazine, que devem ser preenchidos com as munições, elevando a dificuldade de se ter armas de fogo. O Unturned também conta com um pouco do Rust, onde você pode montar sua propria base e craftar inumeros itens, mas ainda não cheguei a testar tudo.A inteligencia artificial dos zumbis é boa, mas, tem alguns pequenos bugs. Como por exemplo, alguns zombis não sobem em determinados objetos (como caixas, carros...). Mas em geral eles te seguem o tempo inteiro, impedindo até de mecher no inventário. Ainda irei jogar mais, já que lançou na Steam, e qualquer coisa, volto a atualizar essa analise. ;)",76561198091688762,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091688762,0

I just can't think of Loadout in the same way anymore.I left the game for others in about October, and this March I decided to give it another go, and for some strange reason, I couldn't find a game.

Now I have to join UK servers with 400 ping just to get a match.Where did the atmosphere go, Edge of Reality?

For one, it has one of the worst management systems for ""friends"" I have ever seen. It is almost impossible to add friends while within the game, so you have to go to the website to do it. The in-game menu is extremely limited, cluttering your screen with oversized button for some things, such as how to spend real-world money, while leaving other buttons, notably those to do with other people and closing smaller menus, incredibly small. Furthermore, the game gives you NO INSTRUCTION WHATSOEVER on how to do anything but gameplay. while it does instruct basic gameplay rather well, it doesn't matter if you can't find your way into a match. While the game does also give you links to guides and intructions by other players on YouTube, these guides and instructions are outdated, and differ (a lot) from what the game is now. However, the gameplay is quite good, and the menus can be navigated with some practice. The major downside is the social system.Edit: I found how to add friends. The instructions on how to do so are halfway down this page that gets openned up by this tiny button in the corner. the instructions are two lines out of hundreds, and in this tiny little text.",76561198065072317,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065072317,0

,Posted May 17.,Last edited May 17.,289090,No ratings yet,False," THE GAME Ampu-Tea OVERIEW OF THE REVIEW Another 'simulator' game trying to riding the coat tails of Surgeon Simulator. This game is tea-dious, frustra-tea-ing, and lacks quali-tea. WHAT IT'S ABOUT Ampu-Tea is a Surgeon Simulator inspired game where you are an amputee fitted with a robotic arm and are tasked with making a cup of tea. In the style of SS, you control your robo-hand to attempt assembling different kinds of teas with the mouse and keyboard. The silly control style provides a challenge to this otherwise simple task and it will test your patience and eventually lead to some chaos. MY EXPERIENCE PLAYING THIS GAME Honestly, this game was a disappointment, and I wasn't even expecting anything from it. My experience playing this game was mostly frustration, thanks to the awful controls and mechanics.There is no grip to pick up anything, so I had to rely on pushing things across the table with the hand and trying to balance cup handles around the fingers. Speaking of the fingers, grabbing with them is incredibly slow and insensitive, along with the hand rotation. It took me half an hour of messing around just to make one cup of tea because of how fragile the mugs are, how easy it is to knock the shelf off the table, the painful journey of moving the cup from each station, and how easy it is to break the arm itself.There is little variety in what types of drinks you can make, and no story or real motivation to make them except for a sticky note. The game description mentions being the son of an Earl, but I found no connection to that in the game. The achievements are (despite the shocking controls) fairly easy to get, minus the one for opening the game 500 times which I did not have the patience for. There are trading cards, but I uninstalled the game before I had enough game time to collect them.The only highlight I managed to draw from this game was being able to flip the table in rage. That's about it. I wish I had more to say. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION In short, Ampu-Tea relies on the 'joke game' factor and being a silly game for YouTubers to play. There are no outstanding features in this game besides being pointlessly difficult and having more 'Keep Calm's and 'EPIC FAIL's than is socially acceptable. It is not worth the $4.99 price tag, but if you really want to play it, wait for it to hit 90% off  on a sale at $0.49. I personally did not enjoy this game and I would not recommend it.",neonsoundwave,http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonsoundwave,0

Getting from dungeon to dungeon takes way to long and I am usually a few points off the reward when the time runs out or get disconnected.As I said this game has a lot of potential but just remeber you will get frustrated from lag.,76561198102409708,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102409708,0

However this game suffers form massive performance issues. Keep in mind I am running a Nvidia GT 750 TI, and I know this is not a great GPU but I did expect to run this game at high settings. The performance issues I have incountered in my roughly 4 hours include:~ Last time I booted up the game I experianced a loading time that took over 10 MINUTES to get into the actual game.~ At sometimes it would tank below 15 FRAMES making it unplayable.~Many audio issues.~Issues unpausing after leaving the game idle.~And while swimming I swam through the map causing me to drownThese are the problems that I have experianced but I've seen online that there are many, MANY more issues with this PC port. It is a shame as this game could have been one of my games of the year but instead like Arkham Knight the performance ruined my experiance. this pains me as a fan of the series, having completed both previouse Just Cause titles.

The gameplay can get very repetitive and boring, and for a beginner it's extremely hard to learn how to play as the shop and item system is quite complex.",purestformation,http://steamcommunity.com/id/purestformation,0

,Posted August 20.,,263060,No ratings yet,True,"Extremamente divertido!Blockstorm tem um potêncial muito alto pelo fato de que o jogador pode personalizar e criar personagens, armas e mapas dentro do próprio jogo e compartilha-los com a comunidade.A mecânica do jogo permite que você destrua quase todo o cenário durante o combate, fazendo com que o jogador crie suas próprias estratégias para combater seus inimigos. Muito parecido com o Ace of Spades clássico.O maior problema que eu encontrei dentro do jogo foi a mira da sniper. Ela é muito afetada pela ""respiração"" do personagem e é muito complicado mante-la onde você quer. Talvez até possa ser considerada uma ""mecânica a ser dominada"" do game pois quando você se acostuma com ela fica muito fácil matar outros jogadores. Mas de qualquer forma é meio chato.Outro ponto negativo (na verdade triste) é que a comunidade do jogo é muito pequena. Por isso alguns modos de jogo estão meio abandonados. Porém a pequena comunidade já criou muita coisa bacana, por exemplo mapas de jogos famosos como o Hijacked do Black Ops 2 (aquele mapa do barco).Minha nota final: 7/10",Feurum,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feurum,0

Also if you install this game, you can get an expansion pack that provides sunlight and a soccer ball. If you do have a girlfriend, I recommend not playing this game because it encourages aggression on the other hand, if your girlfriend likes BDSM all for it. Also, this game dissolves relationships among your friends and promotes being an a55hole. For example, my friend who complains about CS;GO and how he is held back and blames his team mates has now become alot more aggresive and annoying in real life. CS;GO is bad for our youth and encourages offensive language and behavior.There are 4 types of people who play CSGO:1. The Competitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥s (me)2. The Casuals3. The Surfers4. The Bunny ♥♥♥♥♥♥sTL;DR: CS;GO is bad for people who have a functional life but good for people who live in their mum's basement. CS;GO is bad for our youth.",76561198042294034,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042294034,0

The story line and game play is nightmarish thanks to it's gorish atomospher and the more you play the harder it is to stop. It defitnaly sucks you in by the pervasive sense of dread that sets your mind racing at every crunch of glass beneath your feet and every distant groan from an unseen enemy and possible death around every corner.Not to meantion the boss battles they are suitably terrifying, twisted monsters capable of making you shiver at the mere sight of them.Definitely a worth buying game to add to any horror surviving/horror game collection.

In Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet you contol a sopisticated little spaceship in a contrased, sidescrolling planet that has been invaded and intoxicated by shadow to a point where the flora, fauna and the planet itself can potentually harm you. It is your mission to rid the planet of this invading shadow using collectable and upgradeable gadets such as a claw, pulse gun, laser, drill and many more!

The game is alot more unforgiving then the newer titles. You actually have to pay attention to the quest givers and random npc's to find the places you need to go.. It's exciting getting lost! The weapon variety puts Skyrim to shame, Proper katana's, crossbows, Tantos, spears, clubs and the infamous crescent moon! Aswell as the spell variety!

Otherwise a worse-than-average platformer.Full Review:- GameplayThe game and level design is awful. It is a simple platformer with constantly flashing lights that do no part to make the game look nice and your friends don't here what music you are playing. If anything, the music is just what you play in the background. You don't jump, dodge or do anything that is related to the music, fully contrary to what it claims “Discover gameplay with custom music” . There's nothing to customise at all.- ControlsThe controls are also simple but really plain because of the poor execution. You find yourself trying hard to jump, run, dodge, not because it is difficult, but because the game mechanis are just off. You respawn next to the obstacle which continues to run even when you die, so you are essentially waiting for the right moment to jump -- and even then, it doesn't feel fun doing that. It is not tense at all. It is boring jumps and runs all the way. - VerdictI am glad I got it for free.

However, dont waste your time with this sh*t. Poorly optimized, horrid hit registry and pathetic guns and classes. This game encourages team work but doesnt have the basic gameplay fundamentals to support a range of approaches. Your time will be spent walking through fields, looking at low textured walls and hillsides untill someone you cant see, either its due to poor render distance and resolution or theyre just straight up the master of disguise, pushes your brain out of your skull. When this game does go well it is at best a lot of shooting at areas where you think enemies might be, until you are killed and forced to spawn across the map and run all the way back because your squad leader forgot to put down a spawn beacon. Just do yourself a favour, if you want big open spaces and to pretend to be a 'real soldier', play arma. If you want devastating gunplay with walls and surfaces with actual textures, play Insurgency. This is a hybrid of the two that just simply is unnecessary. Feels like ive been here and done it all before, except with a game that actually worked.

Everything I have heard about it is a lie.I do not suggest buying this game and waiting through he 5.9gb download just to be let down.... more like thrown to the ground and stomped. For $30 this is certainly theft.The movement mechanics are shot, everything you step on or walk into has the wrong collisions. Finding materials is glitchy as you cannot pick up items most of the time.Communication, well I played 2 servers, used the voice chat and the global typing and no replies what so ever, so either people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or that isnt working either.YES I UNDERSTAND THE GAME IS ALPHA, but for this much to be going wrong and the game being as old as it is already...

This game however feels like the creators stopped making the game two months into creating it. The graphics are atrocious, the controls are awkward and the gunplay just never feels right, I can get two shot by an smg from a mile away where my sniper whcih says it deals 100 damage (the same amount of hp as a player) body shots FOR 100 damge but the enemy I shot is left with 1 health. Another point to make is that I understand these free games need to make money but making people have to pay money for grenades is just stupid. The higher classes lay waste to the recruit classes and shotguns can destroy from any range (any). It plays very much like an unfinished game. Therefore I dislike this game, I like what it's trying to do (Warface genre) but It misses it's target by so much that it basically gave up on aiming!",Styliishgaming,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Styliishgaming,0

Se voce cair de uma altura minima com o carro ele vai parecer que está quebrando-Combate meele do jogo BUGADO DEMAIS ! Em algumas vezes a animaçao de bater fica bugada, e seu personagem a executa 2 vezes mas dando o dano de apenas uma.-Inteligência artificial (principalmente dos sobreviventes) Horrivel. Aguns deles te prendem em portas, dificultando sua passagem, sem contar que alguns parecem que não sabem pra que que serve a porta e quebram a janela pra sair.-Para um jogo atual os gráficos sao bem ruinzinhos-Os zumbis e hordas spawnam do NADA. Voce acaba de limpar uma área e do NADA voce atrai uma horda ela entra na casa pra te matar, ou voce pode estar andando de carro e do NADA aparece uma horda bem na frente do seu carro justamente pra danificá-lo (ISSO É RIDÍCULO)-Rifles automáticos não compensam, pois gastam muita munição pra matar poucos zumbis. Já os rifles de precisão são bem mais eficazes pois perfuram os zumbis matando tambem os que tiver atrás e consomem bem menos munição assim como as pistolas e révolveres.-Se o seu jogo crashar pode bugar, e o seu personagem irá aparecer na casa só que com os itens que voce pegou sem ter salvo o jogo. (isso é muito escroto por que mesmo sendo bom em alguns aspectos, voce pode perder carro e missões por conta disso)-Apesar disso tudo as missões são bem legais: Nunca vai faltar missões secundárias (isso deixa o jogo mais dinâmico); o sistema de fortificação da casa e o de confiança que os outros sobreviventes tem é bem legal.Minha nota seria 4/10 pra um jogo que poderia ser divertido, Mas é muito estressante por conta de bugs.Espero que tenha ajudado abraço ;P",76561198080426716,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080426716,0

Oh boy, I was wrong. When I clicked the play button, I've suffered enough already and quickly uninstalled it. RaceRoom Racing Experience is a crap game with a load of bullcrap in it and shouldn't be bought by all people for eternity.Yes, the game's graphics and details are pretty good until your ""racing experience"" being annoyed by the terrible car handling and Playstation 1 car sounds. Believe me, handling in here is screwed up and probably the most annoying thing you will encounter in the game. Cars will spin out like crazy with no control at all. This is no racing simulator, it's just a game with glitchy cars spinning around and hit each other.So my final verdict is that, while the game has realistic graphics, the terrible handling just hindered you for maintaining the real racing experience. The game does have a lot of potential, but SimBin, the developers, executed this in a wrong way and that chance is gone forever, and it wouldn't able to compete with current racing games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and Grid.Although patches has been released, still, they're too late to fix RaceRoom's glitchy and broken gameplay.And although I played RaceRoom for a short time, 15 minutes is enough for you to suffer from it's crappy gameplay.Sorry, SimBin, but I have to give this game a 3/10 :(",kazumanyaa,http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazumanyaa,0

,"Posted October 20, 2013.",,250320,No ratings yet,True,"Following on from playing The Walking Dead, I was keen to see what Telltale Games would do next. This game certainly doesn't disappoint. While The Wolf Among Us doesn't have flesh eating zombies, there is still a deep set story steeped in melodrama and intrigue.The Fables are a community of individuals that have escaped their fabled settings and have been forced to take up residency in the real ""mundane"" world. Magicked with Glamour that covers their non-human forms, the Fables try to scrape by in the unfamiliar world. In episode 1 we encounter The Big Bad Wolf, Snow White, Beauty, the Beast, one of the Three Little Pigs, and a winged monkey from The Wizard of Oz, to name a few. While the setting seems childish, it is anything but - with regular profanity throughout the dialogue, and gruesome battle sequences. (I even saw bare breasts in the trailer for episode 2)The choices made in the game effect later events, as was with The Walking Dead, and the first episode ends on a cliff hangar, which had me gasping (as was to be expected).Definitely looking forward to more!",venoix,http://steamcommunity.com/id/venoix,0

Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won't lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren't that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a ♥♥♥♥ ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it's time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has ♥♥♥♥ internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn't affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I've lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you're lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer's chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, ""Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree."" So I go behind 'This tree' and crouch and he walks past me. ""Yeh I'm all good."" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn't move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn't see me. Although he didn't see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn't going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn't the only object I've gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I've played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I'm talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn't even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven't even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn't really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn't give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!",VenomVenti,http://steamcommunity.com/id/VenomVenti,0

Ventured out to find loot. I fell and died. Fair enough. So I respawn back at my base, cause I thought I could create another key for my door, but I obviously couldn't so I couldn't get out. So I suicided by typing kill in the console. Spawned close outside of my base and ran to where I died and my loot was gone, including my key. So I couldn't get in or out of my base and everything I did was a waste of time. I'll have to bust my front door open which can take me a while and because I can't leave my base I can't go to get resources if one of my items break. *sigh*",VenomVenti,http://steamcommunity.com/id/VenomVenti,0

So disappointed in this game.--> The graphics is like I said, a cartoon.--> The animation is really bad. I mean REALLY bad. It's still VERY glitchy.--> The dinosaurs are portrayed as unrealistically stupid and slow. This goes especially for the raptors and T-rex.--> The writing behind this game is a joke.--> Quick Time Events are the devil. This type of gameplay forces you to become disengaged from the story since you are constantly on edge in case you miss a button press.

This game goes far behind a difficultly controlled simulation where you make tea, who the hell ever thought making tea would be so stressful and infuriating at the same time. Once you get the controls, you would figure it gets easier from there, but it's very likely that your robot-hand will start jittering and fly off and you will fail the mission. Learning the controls are one thing, but mastering this game will definitely take some serious patience.The music is happy and full of energy, but about the time it starts getting difficult..

It is in early alpha and it is hard to say whether I think it is worth waiting or picking up now.I personally find the game pretty fun and entertaining, but that is just my competitive side talking. The community is going to be a rough one. Lot of games with this ""Kill or be killed"" mentality often have a horrible community starting out. Lot of people want to kill you because they are curious what you have and want to take it from you. It definitely brings the savages out in the world lol.I think, if you played DayZ, Minecraft and any other survival type game, you may like this game very much, but if the kill or be killed mentality is not for you.. then I would not recommend it. They have non PVP servers, so it may be an option, but majority are PVP.I really think the game needs a way to encourage people to work together, rather than get greedy and become savage bandits. But do so in a way, that does not affect the players negatively. I often like roleplaying with these kind of games, but due to the people out for blood, it makes the roleplay very difficult or impossible.

Would you be a ballistic man spewing rockets and mortar non-stop or would you assemble a drone army? This depends on your luck. The spawn items are random which makes the game have a high replay value. Having the right items can make you feel like a god as you see boss after boss fall before you.The music itself is very unique and fits the game very well and I commend Chris Christodoulou for giving the game so much life. The artstyle may be a turn-off for people who do not appreciate 8-bit graphics. However, it appeals to me particularly the Imp Overlord and the monster logs of each creature you can encounter in the game as such a simple art can be so unique.However this game like anything has its drawbacks. After a certain amount of time collecting the right items combination, it is more of a test of patience instead of a test of endurance. At a certain point you would feel your items and your drones are carrying you into the battle instead of you. Some may find the game a little bit brutal particularly during the boss or the late game as they spawn relentlessly but it may appeal to you as it gives you difficulty and challenge.9.99$ for this game?

You can play through a bunch of single player scenarios which subject you to taking down the odd bad guy, while knowing that a single stray bullet could end your life. These scenarios are all pretty much the same, move on to the next town, take out the five random guys that are wandering around armed with assault rifles, then repeat. It's multiplayer that makes this game shine, a bunch of modded servers like the immensely popular 'Altis Life' mode in which you can play as a civilian or cop. As a civilian you'll buy your drivers license, set off to a life of adventure, get robbed, stripped naked and kneecapped before being abandonded in the desert. In your next life you'll probably head over to the cocaine field to try and make some easy drug money, right? Wrong. As you fill your pockets with unprocessed cocaine (which look suspiciously like rotten cabbages) you'll likely run into a group of like-minded rebels who will make it their business to brutally kill you and take all of your items which you worked so hard for. Then you respawn with nothing and do it all again. As a cop you'll try to stop this from happening, but you'll probably just taze the wrong guy, run him over, then try to pretend like you never did it. You'll brutally murder a bunch of people completely on accident, that is to say, you pull a guy over for speeding, he annoys you so much that you shoot him with your tazer. Then he has a bad reaction to the tazer and the next thing you know you're cleaning up a dead body.Honestly, do I need to say anymore?",thomasonefoot,http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasonefoot,0

You will leave the game dazed and confused. It's brutal; it plays with your head, and it does things no puzzle game ought to do.I can't recommend it on the basis of consistent playability; I've played a mere three hours, and they're on-and-off as I occasionally fire up the game in order to lose myself a bit more. I've also never completed the game, or felt I've ever been close to doing so. What I can recommed it for, is the way it makes you rethink the situation at hand; the way it forces you to think outside the box; the way it pushes you into the unknown and is then quite happy to string you up like a puppet and watch you repeat the same futile exercises over and over, hoping something will change, hoping that you will find another room in which it can mess with your head a little more.Can you escape the Antichamber?",SvDKILLSWITCH,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SvDKILLSWITCH,0

Gunslinger doesn't tote the same budget, publicity and length as the games that came before, but damn is it fun as hell. The story follows a veteran bounty hunter Silas Greaves who shares his adventures to patrons at a bar. Most of the action takes place via flashbacks and while the game is quite linear the fast pace of the game more then makes up for it. The game took me 5 hours to finish and while it was short, i think the length worked well for the game and if the game dragged on for much longer it would have gotten very dry and boring. This game is really fun and worth playing even if you didn't like previous Call of Juarez games.",PhlyQ,http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhlyQ,0

Be prepared to put a few hours in to get it working well.After that I made the mistake of playing this for the story. For me it was an atrocious experience.If you want to play around in a city sandbox and are willing to put the time in to get it running then it is brilliant.However I would warn you away from the base game and point you to the expansions instead.  They are much less painful and come much more highly recommended.If you want a GTA game that is pure fun in solo play then Vice City is a better choice.If you want fun multiplayer go for GTA V.,76561198034823626,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034823626,0

Zombies is just the same crap as it used to be, except there are even more glitches to make it an impossible experience. Multiplayer on the other hand is quite fun. bust MP i have played on any COD i think. it just needs more guns with better mechanics for each. i cannot feel the power of firing the weapons like in Bops1 ( all weapons felt different), instead all the fu*king guns feel the same. and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ glitchyness problems are a pain in the ♥♥♥. has to freeze at least once every two games, and at the most inconvenient times too. fml this will be the last COD i ever play. sick of ♥♥♥♥ devs working under unrealistic timeframes and creating the worst ports to PC in gaming history.

This is a pay-to-progress title, and the devs are workgin on making it less and less so. By reducing the bonuses of being a premium member, they have decreased the in game money gain so everyone needs to farm. There is no reason to get mad when people pay up to $100 for a tank in a video game, it's their moeny and their choice. If this game was pay-to-win, then there would be things that only premium members can access that normal members can't. There are only 2 things that a premium member can access that a F2P member cant. Those are the extra inventory slots for your weapons, which is useless as you can only tkae a maximum of 3 weapons anyway as you cant carry too much weight. The second is an extra combat badge slot, to those who dont know what that is, you can equip 1 badge if F2P and 2 if you are a premium member, these give you small bonuses which dont affect the tide of battle. In saying that, they hardly affect a single soldiers gameplay that much, and can be countered easily with skill. All in all, don't be disgruntled by all the negative reviews from people whining about the game being pay-to-win because its really not. If you feel like you need a game to pass some time then give this a go and make your own call but dont review it after 60 hrs...

But I have played enough to make a review, and my overall review for this game is BUY IT! This game is awesome, it may not be the prettiest and there are still a few bugs to work out but if you want a game that can scare the crap outta you, play this.Now for my experience, I started the game and everything seemed normal enough, I picked up everything, set up some cameras and explored the map. At some point I thought ""Lets go to the night portion... biggest mistake ever! I start up the night and look through my cameras (Im not stupid enough to walk outside during night in a horror game!) and I notice that the cameras have a motion sensor. So I stupidly choose one of the lit up buttons, and witness the RAKE, not only break my camera, but also SCREAM IN MY EAR! I was so scared my heart missed a beat or two. After that I tried to scare the crap out of my friend by making him wear the headphones while I search to find the RAKE. I couldnt find him on the cameras so I head outside to hunt him. After five minutes I see the RAKE in the middle of the path and attack, missing him completely and making him run away. I try to follow but couldnt catch up, so I decide to set up a camera and run back to base. At this point my friend is hearing the RAKE running behind us and think not to tell me incase I look back. He shoulve told me, becauise I turn back and soil myself along with him to the RAKE hitting me, screaming and running away.

Okej - gra za darmo, pozytywnie ją oceniam, ale takie ""wow"" totalne.Grafika nie ma nic tu do życzenia, to samo z oprawą dzwiękową. A historia bawi, i jeszcze śmieszne rozmowy. Spodobało mi się gra z kucykami, gdyż miała w sobie odrobine logiki, to samo z grą platformówką gdzie skaczesz jakimś prostokątem (tutaj skojarzyło mi się lekko z Thomas Was Alone)Innymi słowem: Gra na nudny wieczór warta rzuczenia okiem, przynajmniej na te ponad 30 minut, może nawet mniej. Nie ma zbytnio tam nic do roboty, jedynie trudzenie się z dwoma-trzema podgrami które były w ""Dev Guy"".Jak już mówić o ocenie, to dam to w formie oceny literkowej jak w szkołach w USA czyli: B+.B+ gdyż może i gra fajnie zrobiona, przyjemna, ale jakoś taka krótka, (30 minut, może nawet więcej plus jeszcze napisy to serio dość krótko) za mało w sobie ma, (mam na myśli że chodzi sobie typ, zbiera dane, hakuje czyjeś profile czy Bóg wie co, i gra w dziwne gry, najbeznadziejneszą grą było pewnie jak dla każdego klikanie strzałki żeby wejść do pokoju gdzie znajduje się głupie pudełko - WTF) zdziwiło mnie też to że ta gra została zrobiona na Unreal Engine, a nie na przykład na Unity, ale za to ocena skoczyła w śmieszny sposób do B+.

How on Earth do I explain how utterly mind-melting it is without spoiling the most freakish and complex components of the story?Well, for one thing, the game starts you off with a very simple rules; Time only moves when you do, and red guys are the baddies... or are they???Superhot, or, rather, SUPERHOT makes you question yourself again and again as you go deeper and deeper into the levels. Should I be doing this? What happens if I don't listen? Am I in control? What am I working towards? The game is uniquely frightening for the questions it, not only, makes you ask yourself but also forces you to ponder on.There's not a great way to demonstrate just how odd the game makes you feel without giving away the ending, but it is absolutely worth a try if you're happy to dedicate a few hours to find yourself falling deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole that doesn't want to let go of you. And that's one of the key elements of the game that can creep you out; you are told to stop playing the game, but the game doesn't want you to quit.""The most innovative shooter I've played in years.""",GhostMusic,http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostMusic,0

,"Posted November 19, 2014.",,244850,No ratings yet,False,"First I'll list my problems with this game:- Theres no ingame tutorial. I didn't know what to do with myself when I first played this. It should be explaining as you go what to do and how to do it. Instead it gives you the option to pause the game and watch some 20 minute videos on the Steam forums. That is so stupid. Just explain to me what to do when I'm playing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing.- There is really nothing to do. You can build massive ships and some pretty cool stuff but what after that? Just fly around aimlessly. - The controls are so bad it isnt funny. You press T to interact with objects, to press buttons, get in ships etc, why?T is all the over the other side of the keyboard why would they make one of the most used actions in the game in such an awkward spot. There is 2 jump buttons for some reason, space and F. Why did F have to be a jump button? Why not get rid of that stupid T and replace it with F, and just leave space to jump?And guess what, you can't change the controls.- When flying ships, up is up and down is down. This takes a while to get used to, especially when you've played alot of other flight simulators, where up is down and down is up. To make it even worse, theres no invert look option solely for ships. You can either have it on or off, meaning looking will be inverted when you're on foot to.- Everything is so slippery. You have a jetpack, and its so awkward to manouver yourself. Moving forward makes you tip to the side and flip upside down, while the camera gets stuck and you cant see what youre doing!- The ships arent very clear on how to operate them / interact with them. You see a massive yellow circle sort of thing attached to the bottom of it, so it only makes sense to try and enter the ship that way. No, you have to go over to the dull grey cockpit with no obvious markings to show you enter there.And that concludes my review. Its boring, no tutorial and the most pathetic controls I've ever seen.",76561198049927042,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049927042,0

What were they thinking.Who shakes that much when you are walking so slowly anyway?The game is pretty scary, but Slenderman doesn't really jump out at you much, he sort of just watches you.

It is NOT a bad game. In fact, this game is amazing, and if you have never played Heroes before this game is my suggestion as to where you should start the journey. The reason for my down vote is simply because I paid $17 for nostalgia and that's pretty much it. Granted the graphics are better, but they weren't ever truly terrible for what the game was, and I feel overall not much else was done for it. It does not include all content which only adds to further disappointment and unless you're playing against people of your skill level, multiplayer is a joke (if it even works). The only solution I can see to correct this problem is to release the other 50% of the game (yes, the additional content accounted for pretty much 50% of the game) for free to those who have currently purchased the game and to add the random map generation.Whilst I still enjoy playing the game it's disappointing to know how unfinished this rerelease is, especially when it is an obvious cash-grab rereleasing a game for today's desktops.",76561198052853176,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052853176,0

While these don't sound relatively menacing, in a regular game these equate to Extremely Hard and Impossible difficulties. During the game, you take on the role of a captain of a spaceship and will usually fail horribly at it. But sometimes you won't. Sometimes you will get to the Last Stand (with a great deal of hope and lots of preparation), telling yourself that you will win and everything will turn out fantastically. 2 minutes later, you will admit a soul-crushing defeat and begin crying on your bed. When you stop crying, you will play this game over and over again and you will love every minute of it, because this game is absolutely brilliant.

I don't want to spoil this game for any one who hasn't played it, but in short Undertale is a RPG that's willing to take everything you know about the genre, and challenge it to a godlike level, while still remaining a ""Role-Playing Game"". As you play, be wary of the term 'Role-Playing', as you may find that as time goes on your part in the game is more than just a mere 'role'.I genuinely love this game, and hope it's appreciated for years at the very least, because there isn't a single RPG (out of 100's of classics I myself have played, like Chrono Trigger, FF7 etc.) that has handled emotion and character development as well as Undertale.P.S.

Warface is a try-hard, want to be Call of Duty with clunky, awful gameplay whilst trying (and failing) to implement tactical features and functions. Warface also has one of the worst Pay-2-Win systems I have ever experienced and actually makes me cringe to the core. There is an in-depth review below but the bottom line is; Don't play it. In-Depth Review  Gameplay Like I said above, the gameplay is clunky and doesn't ""flow"" well. I often find that sprinting makes my screen clanky and jagged and when I shoot my weapon it seems too.....rough? Pardon my low-effecient vocabulary. Tactical Play (with some community banter) One of the tactical features in Warface is to help one of your poor-tasted buddies onto a higher ledge and vice versa. I don't think the Devs knew how sh*t their games community was going to be (hint: it's very similiar to COD, maybe even worse) These features seem tacky and useless, used just to add some ""innovation"" to their game. Pay-2-Win Never in my life have I played a game where I have to RENT an ingame gun and not have the choice to keep it permanently, despite all those hard-earned game duckets I spent on it. Note: I haven't played that much of the game and do NOT have a full understanding of the market system. EZ game EZ life I'm really bad at Call of Duty, like awful, so I assumed that I would be bad at this also, that was until I went on a 15 kill streak in my first game. I know the majority of FPS is all just ""point-n-shoot"" but come ON FAM, THIS IS TOO EASY! Theres next to no recoil control or bullet drop, you can kill some nerd across the map with a couple of well placed bullets from the standard, beginner assault rifle and the slide feature allows any skirken to slide inbetween my legs and topple me even if he has awful aim NO SOUTH-PACIFIC REGIONAL SERVERS WTF!?!?! Crytek seems to think the world is a weird, pacman sort of shape because they apparently don't know New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa etc exist because they didn't create any f*cking dedicated servers for them, this is a personal issue but it should be resolved regardless of how bad the rest of the game is.

,"Posted June 7, 2014.",,242760,No ratings yet,False,"The most unfinished, unballenced, glitchiest game since battlefield 4. When they say ""Early Access"" they litterally mean that jack ♥♥♥♥ works. I spent two hours grinding for wood, built a log cabin and was about to place the final TWO blocks of the ninety required, and suddenly some mutants randomly spawned infront of me, killing me instantly.Overall i would rate this game a 2/10 the only reason its two and not motherf*cking 0, is that it lets you slap mutants with their own f*cking arms.This game is NOT worth $14.99 in its current stage and should not be on steam. In my opinion this Early Access game realease  is comparable to the release of ""The War Z"" Or ""infestation: survivor stories"" as it was renamed.The developers of both these games should have thought long and hard before releasing such a sh*tty unfinished game onto steam, and valve themselves should be ashamed to have this in their library.To sum up this review, You should SERIOUSLY do some solid research before purchasing this. At the time i purchased it you could not even save the game, which was not clearly stated ANYWHERE on the store page and was clearly a gigantic flaw. I realise this has now been adressed and in future perhaps the many flaws in this game will be, however in its current state it is unplayable unless all you wish to do is slash mutants appart and build trophies out of there body parts, or atttempt to go swimming and end up flying above the entire map (Because F*ck logic).

Now, obviously no one is going to buy this game for the gameplay because it is just about as simple as point and click games go (meaning it has a lot of pointing and clicking), but the story grips you by the lapels and eats at your brain with all the twists, turns and choices you make. The only bad thing i could say is that maybe they could have used more keys for action rather than just the Q and E keys, i mean i think after plaing The Walking Dead: Season 2 (and posibly The Wolf Among Us) my Q key will resmble all the zombie heads i smashed during this game.Final words: If you like the look of it or have had it recomended to you, you'd being doing the gaming comunity a diservice if you didn't have it on your library.",TheMainEventer,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMainEventer,0

The Characters are sh*t, The Animations for skills suck, The story lines are lame. How bad can one game be? The Story of an average mapler. One day a person randomly overhears some of his friends talking about maplestory. He gets curious so he finds out what it is and downloads the game. He starts to play the game, it isn't too bad, he makes friends, he has fun. - Few months later. The person gets addicted to the game and is ""mapling"" 24/7. He also spends $10 - $50 everyday for the Nexon's in-game currency known as ""Nexon Cash"" or ""NX""After a while his friends disappear, and makes new friends and they disappear too.HE does this for 5 years until one day he looks at the game properly and thinks to himself. ""What have I done during the past 5 years?"" He then proceeds to view his purchase history, his characters, his life.What has happened during the past 5 years you may ask? Well. This person wasted his money, his time, his relationships and most of all his LIFE. It is far too hard to comeback from maplestory if you played it for such a long time, and when you do, I'll tell you, you will never look at the game the first time you looked at it. How ""innocent"" it is, How ""fun"" it is. The only exception you can see to is that you have friends whom play the game.

Realmente no lo recomiendo, solo pasaras malos ratos sufriendo por partidas desbalanceadas, Hackers, bugs masivos y un contenido mediocre que el juego te ofrece.

,"Posted December 2, 2015.",,31290,No ratings yet,True,"Realmente fascinante, tener un juego de la famosa trilogía del señor Spielberg es increíble. Ya han pasado varios meses desde que estamos en el futuro y seguro Marty querría que jugaramos esto, ya saben, para detener las paradojas temporales y regresar la línea del tiempo a donde debe de estar. Los controles son... Buenos, ¿qué puedo decir? En esos momentos Telltale no tenía las mecánicas de ahora con The Walking Dead. Aunque los puzzles se puedan resolver con las pistas, puedes hacerlo a la antiguita,  tratando con todo hasta dar con uno.Excelente banda sonora, me encanta, sobretodo porque ponen el tema principal de las cintas aquí. Un juego que, aunque puede ser tedioso al esperar a que cargue un poco y puede que, sino le entiendes al inglés te desespere un poco, merece la pena tenerlo en la biblioteca, totalmente. Y más si quieres recordar sobre la ya con 30 años lanzamiento, ""trilogía temporal"" de Spielberg.Gracias Steam y larga vida a TT Games.

,"Posted November 1, 2015.",,316790,No ratings yet,True,"Puedo decir ahora, que después de terminar el juego te quedas con ganas de más. Lamentablemente LucasArt fue cerrado hace ya 2 años, pero sus buenos juegos vivirán en los corazones de muchos. El tipo de juego que es Grim Fandango es aventura gráfica (como cualquier otro de LArts), que se basa en la fiesta tradicional mexicana: ""Día de Los Muertos"" con un toque de humor absurdo-gráfico en ella. De igual manera se encuentran guiños a la cultura mexicana y latina, como tenemos a un personaje inspiridado en lo que se ve, al Che Guevara (Salvador Limones). En sí, el juego narra una gran historia con personajes variados y con un buen tono de color (hasta se ponen azules de la asfixia, literalmente), tiene un buenísimo guión, es muy extenso y elaborado de tal manera que hace no parezca de relleno cierta situación, de modo que, al final todo encaja perfectamente. Al ser la remasterización de uno de los primeros trabajos de Lucas Arts en 3D, y me parece excelente que la llegada a la plataforma de Steam haya sido un éxito con, hasta su Soundtrack en venta.Hablando de Soundtrack, es fascinate. Tiene Jazz, instrumentales clásico, románticos y le da un placer al oido esuchar tan sagradas melodías compuestas por Peter McConnell, que dice, haber ido a México para poder realizar su banda sonora.Si buscan un juego para pasar el rato y sacarle el jugo a los logros, éste es uno de los buenos. Compralo, no te arrepentirás, es un hecho que las avemturas gráficas son grandiosas para abrir tu mente y hacerte ver la lógica.",76561198091429493,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091429493,0

,"Posted October 25, 2014.",,218620,4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful,False,"It is evident from the start that this game is only intended to be played online. Ideally, a game should be a perfectly good standalone with an online option for later once you've completed everything else and have become bored. This is the opposite. A multiplayer with a single player tacked on as an afterthought. Ignoring the poor graphics and general design reminiscent of Postal 2 and similar games which were never intended to be taken seriously, the design of the AI in this game is appaling. By far the worst I've ever seen. Not only the enemy AI but your own team. No attempt was made to make the team anything more than backup muscle. Team members can't be ordered to hold/attack positions or execute objectives. They follow you around stupidly and shoot at things which happen to stand directly in front of them, not even noticing when they are being repeatedly shot. The enemy AI is similarly stupid not noticing things in plain sight but they have the advantage of clipping through you and your team to get behind you very quickly. So there's that. Not to mention overwhelming force.Granted the game is designed to hold off violent confrontation as long as possible but with the AI the way it is, this is impossible. Playing offline will guarantee police arriving within a minute and that would lead one to hope that the gunplay mechanics are at least decent. They are not. Besides the lack of reticle (which, ok I can live with but is odd given the hit confirmation reticle) the aiming moving and shooting are all pretty bad. Nothing horrendously wrong, but poor all round.On the issue of weapons however, it is impossible to pick up weapons from fallen cops and it's obvious that in order to enjoy a decent range of weapons you basically need to get the DLC. Now I have a $20 limit on games and this is NOT about to convince me to break that limit any time soon and with the current discounts I can justify some of the DLC which would allow me to make the game at least presentable. Wanting players to join the steam fanpage in order to unlock a bunch of basic gear is I feel rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's a pretty low tactic to force people to be exposed to your promotions in exchange for making the one game they did buy semi-playable. A very DLC based experience and as such, a poor game.As for the levels, they're the same. I'll be doing a different job and running through the building on autopilot because I've seen it before except that the safe is in a different location now.And why does it keep updating? It feels like every time I start the game it needs to do an update. Games should never be updated, make an optional patch, and distribute bugfixes ASAP but any major overhauls save for the sequel.All in all, I'm hoping that once I play multipler with friends (the only reason I was told to get the game) it'll become somewhat good, but as far as going it solo to try and build up those skill points goes, it is a painful painful experience, not even worth the bandwidth to download the base game imho.",76561198094722660,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094722660,0

The game is borderline unplayable at the moment with nothing optimised, bland menu screens, and it just gives new players a really hard time. It's so hard to find decent weapons/loot at the start of the game and finding water .... don't get me started on finding water.It is still in alpha and I understand that. I just really think that, at the moment, you should buy this for when it comes out and not for the alpha. The finished game will be undoubtedly great!Like I said, I believe this game has potential, but I also believe that Rust easily rivals it at the moment.For the moment, I'm giving this game a 6/10 but only for how it is at the moment. I'm sure that will be bumped up to a 10/10 when it is finished (or at least out of alpha).",sh06un1,http://steamcommunity.com/id/sh06un1,0

,"Posted January 31, 2015.",,319510,3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful,True,"Five Nights at Freddy's received positive reviews from critics. Indie Game Magazine praised Five Nights at Freddy's for its simple take on the horror genre, noting that its artistic direction and gameplay mechanics contributed to a feeling of ""brutal tension"" — worsened by how a player may be familiar with similar restaurants such as Chuck E. Cheese's, and that ""it's an incredibly terrifying experience to try to save yourself from the single jump scare that ends the game."" In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's was considered a ""fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying."" However, the game was criticized for taking too long to load when launched.[1] Omri Petitte for PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy's a score of 80 out of 100[2], commenting that the game took a ""less-is-more"" approach to its design, and that while ""the AI isn't some masterwork of procedural unpredictability,"" it would ""[still] head straight to you and eat your face off, or it'll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill. Your mind will fill in the rest."" The game's overall atmosphere was praised for emphasizing the fear and suspense of an approaching threat, rather than the arrival of the threat itself, as executed in other horror-oriented games. However, the gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy's was criticized for becoming repetitive once a player masters it, as there is ""not much more to expect beyond managing battery life and careful timing of slamming doors shut, so those with steely willpower won't find anything else past the atmosphere of it all."" Ryan Bates of Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5; comparing its camera-oriented gameplay to the 1992 game Night Trap, he praised the game's minimalistic presentation (with particular emphasis on its audio design and lack of music) for contributing to the terror of the game, along with the fact that the ""nervous impulses"" of its repetitive gameplay would ""[reach] almost OCD-type levels, adding to the tense environment."" In conclusion, he felt that the game was ""horror done right,"" but that it was too short. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef compared the animatronic animals in the game to Weeping Angels — predatory creatures from the universe of Doctor Who — due to their ability to only move when they are not being observed.[3] Softpedia gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it ""drifts away from the classic first-person horror survival titles,"" but that the ""inability to move combined with the limited power available will make you feel quite helpless in front of those relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their 'love' with you.""[4] ",42456,http://steamcommunity.com/id/42456,0

I realise it's ment to me realistic but still it's very annoying when for instence your a sniper, and out of no where you egt killed by some random player but you dont know who it was or what weapon they killed you with! i personaly think this is rediculous it would be nice if the creators could add this feature? im very sorry if this is needy ect.
