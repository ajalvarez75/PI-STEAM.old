1 person found this review funny,"Posted September 7, 2014.",,236430,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"Com o sucesso estrondoso de Dark Souls era mais do que esperado uma sequencia, mas como todo jogo muito bom, sequencias dão medo pela maioria das vezes não conseguirem ser tão bons quanto os seus originais. Dark Souls 2 não faz parte dessa maioria.Como no primeiro de sua serie o foco do jogo é sobre a maldição (curse), que quando infecta um humano não permite sua morte, mas o ressucita cada vez com menos sanidade e humanidade ate o ponto onde ele fica totalmente insano e selvagem.Centenas de milenios apos os acontecimentos de Dark Souls, Você é introduzido ao seu personagem que esta amaldiçoado, porem, ainda mantem sua sanidade e esta a procura de uma cura, isso o leva a procura por Drangleic, um reino onde se acredita que tenha a resposta contra essa maldição, ao chegar em tal mundo você descobre que nem tudo é como você esperava.Assim como em Dark Souls a historia do jogo é minimalista, para entender tudo é necessario conversar com todos os personagens, ler as descrições de itens e reparar nos visual deslumbrantes que escondem o passado deste reino misterioso. o jogo não lhe apresenta nenhum objetivo, nenhum indicador de onde você deve ir ou algum caminho especifico mas confia em você para explorar sozinho e encontrar seu proprio caminho.O foco de gameplay é seu sistema de combate, simples em primeira mão mas que se torna complexo com o passar do tempo.apesar de ser um rpg onde você pode aumentar status, trocar de equipamento e forjar armas, o jogo aposta mais na sua capacidade de se adaptar aos diferente tipos de inimigos e seus ataques, desde o mais simples esqueleto ao enorme dragão que cospe fogo. a variedade de equipamentos e armas usaveis são mais aproveitaveis ainda quando não se há a limitação por classes ou seja, você pode usar uma espada enorme em uma mão enquanto na  outra desfere magias devastadoras com um cajado, o que balanceia isso é a necessidade de status para que possa se usar com eficiencia essas mecanicas, mas como no jogo não há limite de leveis e você pode relocar seus pontos de status é um alivio para quem não gosta de seguir builds de ponta a ponta. o jogo no inicio te introduz algumas classes porem elas só definem seu equipamento inicial e seus pontos iniciais, elas não limitam o que você pode ser. Seu dinheiro e experiencia são uma coisa só: almas que são obtidas derrotando inimigos ou usando itens, mas há um porem, quando morto você perdera todas suas almas e para recuperalas tera que voltar onde morreu, se nesse meio tempo for morto de novo, adeus a tudo que conseguiu.Os visuais tambem não deixam a desejar, com vistas epicas e inimigos enormes você sempre estara impresionado com o que acontece a sua volta, os minimos detalhes que escondem a historia deste reino perdido são suas pistas para descobrir o que aconteceu, e claro o ambiente, a musica te da uma imersão ainda maior, em um mundo depressivo onde a desgraça caiu sobre os humanos você percebe esse ar gotico e sua orchestra funebreSeu sistema multiplayer consiste em algo unico, cada jogador tem seu mundo e suas ações são independentes em outros mundos porem você pode influenciar outros jogadores com mensagens deixadas no chão ou ate mesmo com poças de sangue que mostram como você morreu, esse recurso é usado para que o jogador aprenda sobre o que vai acontecer e o que pode fazer para evitar. mais influente ainda você pode ser invocado a outro mundo como um fantasma que vai ajudar o dono do mundo a matar os inimigos mas tambem você pode invadir outros mundos para matar seu dono e obter suas almasassim é o sistema cooperativo e PVP do jogoO unico erro é o design das fases que as vezes quebram um pouco da imersão total do jogo e algumas fases que parecem ter sido feitas as pressas pela sua simplicidade, mas nem todas são assimMas o que faz esse jogo tão aclamado? simples. Sua dificuldade.Dark Souls II faz jus ao seu antecessor nesta questão, o jogo não te introduz dicas,marcações,fraquezas ou qualquer outro tipo de ajuda que os jogos modernos nos trazem, ele é diferente, ele confia no jogador em descobrir as coisas sozinhos mesmo que isso signifique morrer milhares de vezes ate aprender um padrão de movimento de um inimigo, não se deixe enganar você vai morrer e vai aprender o quão importante é a habilidade antes de seu equipamentoBonito, Inteligente e brutal essas são as palavras que definem esse ótimo jogo.",LionBrito,http://steamcommunity.com/id/LionBrito,0

Perfect in every way BUT becomes completely stupid when players can just teleport into a plane (fighter or bomber) use it to kill you then apear back in their own tank completly unharmed. No flying skills are even needed, you can just crash the plane into a tank and disable it or destroy it. This feature is just stupid and is a game breaker. To have game after game of ground battles decided by who is first to gain air superiority is stupid. If you do play the game dont waste money on it, there will be plenty of times you are betten in completely stupid ways that bear no resembalance to a proper ground battle tactic and it will make you angry more often than you have fun games.

So i try to play the game again later, after leaving it for a while, i log in, it works, it goes to character select, i choose my character and click ""enter world"". It goes to the loading screen and when it reaches 100% the screen goes black, the window closes and it gives me some stupid reason, trying to explain why the game crashed..... so i kept trying to open the game and it kept doing the same crash. 10/10 waste of time to get the game DO NOT get this worthless crap.",slaydread,http://steamcommunity.com/id/slaydread,0

So you can customize your killstreak loadout, okay but a lot of them are broken and one killstreak is called the Care Package and it takes 3 kills to get. With only 3 kills you can get a freaking AC-130 and cut up the enemy team. The worst killstreak is the nuke as it instantly ends the match. There's a barragement of overpowered and underpowered weapons, the ACR wrecks all enemies and the M16 might as well not be there. The map design is horrid, offering infinite opportunities for camping. There's also deathstreaks which can increase your health, give you your killer's loadout, etc.Then there's the community; teenagers claiming to have sexual relations with your mother, idiots who tell you to kill yourself because you're the host and the game is laggy without them realizing that the netcode is horrid, people who run around the map quickscoping/trickshotting instead of playing the game, people who intentionally make their loadout overpowered, etc. It's a blitzkrieg of flawed game design and you shouldn't spend your money on it.",itsdandytime,http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsdandytime,0

Unfortunately they have not. The core of the gameplay, attacking and blocking the opposition is still broken to the point that the game is not fun, but provides a frustrating experience.It creates anger every time you play it becuase the game field is not fair. Everything feels slow and clunky becuase all the servers lag so badly. Some are better than others, but in the end, those with the best pings will dominate. It is not uncommon to die 10 times and only get 1 kill becuase the lag is so bad. Your actions on screen are not registered and all you end up doing is getting killed unfairly as hits go through your block. This repeats every match, every game.If Torn Banner actually cared about the game, they would have attempted to fix it after all these years instead of making a DLC for it. I cannot recommed this game to anyone, not even when it is on sale as I feel like I should be entitled to a refund. It is not fun nor challenging.

Being a goat is like being a god to me and this game made me feel like i was the god of gods, the alpha god. The game story driven gameplay gets you so immursed you feel like the game isn't a game anymore, it becomes reality. A lot happened to me early in 2014, i watched my parents die right in front of my eyes so of course i retreated to video games. Goat Simulator saved my life, after my parents died i became deeply depressed, i was planning to off my self but then i picked up Goat Simulator, and life became beatiful again. In conclusion, all i have to say is: Goats are like dogs, but they're not.

,"Posted August 4, 2013.",Last edited January 11.,72850,No ratings yet,True,"Creo, para mi gusto, que no puedo criticarle nada a BETHESDA, para mi uno de sus mejores juegos, aunque en el juego hay algunos bugs son facilmente resolvibles, pienso que es un juego muy bien hecho, llenos de aventuras y batallas por librar... Lo que me encanta es que es un juego muy libre, no es necesario seguir un orden y nunca termina ya que es un gran mundo por explorar. Es un videojuego de rol de acción del tipo mundo abierto desarrollado por Bethesda Game Studios y publicado por Bethesda Softworks. Es la quinta entrega de videojuegos de acción y fantasía de la serie The Elder Scrolls y es posterior a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion y predecesor de The Elder Scrolls Online. Skyrim salió a la venta el 11 de noviembre de 2011 para las plataformas: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 y PlayStation 3. El 4 de junio de 2013 fueron lanzados al mercado tres complementos descargables: Dawnguard, Hearthfire y Dragonborn.La historia de Skyrim se centra en los esfuerzos del personaje del jugador para derrotar a Alduin, un dragón que, según la profecía, destruirá el mundo. La trama está fechada doscientos años después de los sucesos de Oblivion y tiene lugar en la provincia ficticia de Skyrim. En el transcurso de la partida, el jugador completa misiones y hace evolucionar a su personaje gracias al mejoramiento de sus habilidades. A diferencia de los juegos anteriores de Elder Scrolls, en Skyrim no se requiere que el usuario seleccione un tipo de personaje al inicio del juego, resolviendo así el problema que el equipo de desarrolladores veía desde de versiones anteriores: la necesidad de tener que forzar al usuario a un estilo rígido de juego. Skyrim continúa con la tradición de mundo abierto al permitir que el jugador viaje a cualquier parte del mapa del juego en cualquier momento y postponer indefinidamente u omitir parcial o totalmente la historia principal.Aunque no es una secuela directa de los anteriores juegos de Elder Scrolls, durante su construcción fue considerado como un sucesor de la filosofía de Oblivion y de Fallout 3 de 2008. El equipo de desarrolladores optó por un mundo de juego más diverso y único de lo que fue la comarca ficticia de Cyrodiil en Oblivion, los cuales fueron considerados menos interesantes por su director y productor ejecutivo Todd Howard, en comparación con Skyrim. Durante el estreno, recibió buenas críticas por sus cambios, sobre todo en lo tocante al sistema de desarrollo de los personajes, gracias a la experiencia ganada durante el desarrollo de las entregas anteriores de Elder Scrolls. No obstante, también recibió críticas negativas en cuanto a la pobreza del acabado en los detalles de los personajes y a los escuetos movimiento durante un combate cuerpo a cuerpo. El juego fue desarrollado utilizando un motor de creación elaborado por Bethesda Softworks específicamente para este juego. Durante la primera semana de su lanzamiento se enviaron a los minoristas más de siete millones de copias y ha vendido más de 20 millones de copias para las tres plataformas.",pabloagecrash,http://steamcommunity.com/id/pabloagecrash,0

Capcom will introduce the ability to micro pay for  the colours soon enough.Capcom have made characters / uniforms ""earnable"" in an upcoming update but with the outragiously low earn rates  they have essentually made all items in the game forevermore microtransactions.Addendum.Capcom have not improved on multiplayer game play, rage quitting abounds.They have introduced the ability to micro pay for the colors behind the artifically hard survival mode, as i predicted.SFV + all current DLC will already, six months in, cost you $250.Fight Money is still criminally hard to come by, and DLC being introduced is only purchasable via real money, rendering fight money quite useless.",illogik01,http://steamcommunity.com/id/illogik01,0

Mesmo os gráficos já estando um pouco ultrapassados, o gameplay é muito bom e a história ainda melhor. È um game em que uma missão te é dada e você literalmente pode resolver da maneira que te convém, cada forma tendo consequências diferentes. Tudo que você decide no jogo, faça ou não parte da missão principal, te afeta no futuro e as personagens ao seu redor notam.Primeiramente tive bastante preconceito com o game por ser um RPG (eu detesto RPGs), mas conforme fui jogando fui me apaixonando pelo game.

,"Posted July 2, 2014.",Last edited June 28.,221380,No ratings yet,False,"IT'S BAD. I regret buying it. (note, includes African Kingdoms and Forgotten campaigns).The artwork put into the structurse in African Kingdoms is truly a sight to behold... but that's really all the praise I have for it.Based on Age of Kings- a game that sadly isn't as fun as I remembered; here are the reasons I hate this game. It's extremely buggy and prone to crashes. The interface and AI is shamefully bad  and the gameplay is really quite boring and annoying. Expect units (yours and enemy alike) to get confused by simple orders and easily distracted from attacking an enemy unit to instead focus on a harmless nearby building or to put together a (pointless) formation.Worst of all are the campaigns. 90% are escort missions with hardly any base-building parts (the whole point of Age of Empires games) at all. Unlike other RTSs, AOK's combat dynamics are terrible. So you sit bored out of your mind as you guide your clumsy squad around an obstacle course where every ""combat"" situation involves your squad slowly chipping away at an enemy until they (eventually) win.",76561197982685987,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982685987,0

,Posted August 23.,,394510,No ratings yet,True,"Um game simplesmente incrível, em perspectiva isométrica, o game entrega uma experiência muito divertida, mas isso já era esperado basta observar que o game foi feito nos moldes do Magika, parabéns para o studio que conseguiu criar um novo jogo com base em um anterior sem ser um mero ctrl + c, ctrl + v. Singleplayer: Bem como todo game sem um modo história, jogar sozinho e mesmo enjoativo no longo prazo, mas e muito bom para jogar enquanto espera outro download terminar. Multiplayer: A zoeira não tem limites, primeiro pelo coop local de 4 player, a mecânica de todos os players estarem na mesma tela, é perfeita pois faz com que os jogadores trabalhem em equipe, e isso para mim foi o ponto forte do game, pois um game com conteúdo PVE forte, não deve ser só desafiador coisa que ele é, mas também divertido e dar risadas quando perder. DLC's: Recomendo 2 para quem não quer comprar todos, o Ranger Pack e o Support Pack, irão facilitar muito, o ranger por causa do UAV que scaneia amostras (ótimo para fazer um farmzinho), e o Support por causa do Drone de cura e a Carbine laser que se você controlar o aquecimento e praticamente infinita.

,"Posted July 19, 2014.",,304930,No ratings yet,True,"Joguei pouco enquanto estava na Steam, por conta do erro no servidor. No entanto joguei antes de publicarem, quando havia como jogar se registrando no site.Bem, o jogo é bom. Sua 'economia' nos gráficos não fazem o jogo ser ruim. Apesar de está em ""Acesso Antecipado"" o jogo não possui grandes bugs, no entanto, em alguns momentos o jogo parece um ""Walking Simulator"", já que o mapa mesmo sendo pequeno, faz você ficar andando muito tempo até chegar em alguma base/cidade para pegar os itens. Mas, como existem veiculos (que precisam de reparos e combustivel), é o melhor jeito de se locomover.Uma coisa também que é 'ruim' é o número de pessoas no servidor, que até onde ví só suportam até 12 pessoas, e mesmo assim muitos servers contam com apenas 8 slots. O jogo também possui um sistema de construção, mas que não sei como funciona ainda. E tem outra, o jogo tem vários tipos de munições e magazine, que devem ser preenchidos com as munições, elevando a dificuldade de se ter armas de fogo. O Unturned também conta com um pouco do Rust, onde você pode montar sua propria base e craftar inumeros itens, mas ainda não cheguei a testar tudo.A inteligencia artificial dos zumbis é boa, mas, tem alguns pequenos bugs. Como por exemplo, alguns zombis não sobem em determinados objetos (como caixas, carros...). Mas em geral eles te seguem o tempo inteiro, impedindo até de mecher no inventário. Ainda irei jogar mais, já que lançou na Steam, e qualquer coisa, volto a atualizar essa analise. ;)",76561198091688762,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091688762,0

It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs.I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end.I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now.The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player....You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies.But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just.........

Oh boy, I was wrong. When I clicked the play button, I've suffered enough already and quickly uninstalled it. RaceRoom Racing Experience is a crap game with a load of bullcrap in it and shouldn't be bought by all people for eternity.Yes, the game's graphics and details are pretty good until your ""racing experience"" being annoyed by the terrible car handling and Playstation 1 car sounds. Believe me, handling in here is screwed up and probably the most annoying thing you will encounter in the game. Cars will spin out like crazy with no control at all. This is no racing simulator, it's just a game with glitchy cars spinning around and hit each other.So my final verdict is that, while the game has realistic graphics, the terrible handling just hindered you for maintaining the real racing experience. The game does have a lot of potential, but SimBin, the developers, executed this in a wrong way and that chance is gone forever, and it wouldn't able to compete with current racing games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and Grid.Although patches has been released, still, they're too late to fix RaceRoom's glitchy and broken gameplay.And although I played RaceRoom for a short time, 15 minutes is enough for you to suffer from it's crappy gameplay.Sorry, SimBin, but I have to give this game a 3/10 :(",kazumanyaa,http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazumanyaa,0

Ventured out to find loot. I fell and died. Fair enough. So I respawn back at my base, cause I thought I could create another key for my door, but I obviously couldn't so I couldn't get out. So I suicided by typing kill in the console. Spawned close outside of my base and ran to where I died and my loot was gone, including my key. So I couldn't get in or out of my base and everything I did was a waste of time. I'll have to bust my front door open which can take me a while and because I can't leave my base I can't go to get resources if one of my items break. *sigh*",VenomVenti,http://steamcommunity.com/id/VenomVenti,0

As a hardcore fan of the novels and movies, I feel Telltale have horribly ruined the concept of Jurassic Park. I cringed the entire way through this very long cartoon. So disappointed in this game.--> The graphics is like I said, a cartoon.--> The animation is really bad. I mean REALLY bad. It's still VERY glitchy.--> The dinosaurs are portrayed as unrealistically stupid and slow. This goes especially for the raptors and T-rex.--> The writing behind this game is a joke.--> Quick Time Events are the devil. This type of gameplay forces you to become disengaged from the story since you are constantly on edge in case you miss a button press. (If they show, still buggy)The game is basically a cartoon to watch. There's no control. It's entirely QTE. You might as well watch this on YouTube.To save youself some money, watch the game here.

Warface is a try-hard, want to be Call of Duty with clunky, awful gameplay whilst trying (and failing) to implement tactical features and functions. Warface also has one of the worst Pay-2-Win systems I have ever experienced and actually makes me cringe to the core. There is an in-depth review below but the bottom line is; Don't play it. In-Depth Review  Gameplay Like I said above, the gameplay is clunky and doesn't ""flow"" well. I often find that sprinting makes my screen clanky and jagged and when I shoot my weapon it seems too.....rough? Pardon my low-effecient vocabulary. Tactical Play (with some community banter) One of the tactical features in Warface is to help one of your poor-tasted buddies onto a higher ledge and vice versa. I don't think the Devs knew how sh*t their games community was going to be (hint: it's very similiar to COD, maybe even worse) These features seem tacky and useless, used just to add some ""innovation"" to their game. Pay-2-Win Never in my life have I played a game where I have to RENT an ingame gun and not have the choice to keep it permanently, despite all those hard-earned game duckets I spent on it. Note: I haven't played that much of the game and do NOT have a full understanding of the market system. EZ game EZ life I'm really bad at Call of Duty, like awful, so I assumed that I would be bad at this also, that was until I went on a 15 kill streak in my first game. I know the majority of FPS is all just ""point-n-shoot"" but come ON FAM, THIS IS TOO EASY! Theres next to no recoil control or bullet drop, you can kill some nerd across the map with a couple of well placed bullets from the standard, beginner assault rifle and the slide feature allows any skirken to slide inbetween my legs and topple me even if he has awful aim NO SOUTH-PACIFIC REGIONAL SERVERS WTF!?!?! Crytek seems to think the world is a weird, pacman sort of shape because they apparently don't know New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa etc exist because they didn't create any f*cking dedicated servers for them, this is a personal issue but it should be resolved regardless of how bad the rest of the game is.

Solo a los alemanes les dan buenas cosas, mientras que a los demás puras ♥♥♥♥♥♥s nerfeadas . De lejos uno de los peores juegos de la 2GM que he jugado.  Lo mas triste es que cuando lo empecé a jugar por primera vez (Por el 2014 creo) se veía que era un juego prometedor, y que tenia futuro, pero tras pasar los años, uno se da cuenta de que la compañía del juego “Reto” es bastante incompetente . Realmente no lo recomiendo, solo pasaras malos ratos sufriendo por partidas desbalanceadas, Hackers, bugs masivos y un contenido mediocre que el juego te ofrece.

,"Posted November 1, 2015.",,316790,No ratings yet,True,"Puedo decir ahora, que después de terminar el juego te quedas con ganas de más. Lamentablemente LucasArt fue cerrado hace ya 2 años, pero sus buenos juegos vivirán en los corazones de muchos. El tipo de juego que es Grim Fandango es aventura gráfica (como cualquier otro de LArts), que se basa en la fiesta tradicional mexicana: ""Día de Los Muertos"" con un toque de humor absurdo-gráfico en ella. De igual manera se encuentran guiños a la cultura mexicana y latina, como tenemos a un personaje inspiridado en lo que se ve, al Che Guevara (Salvador Limones). En sí, el juego narra una gran historia con personajes variados y con un buen tono de color (hasta se ponen azules de la asfixia, literalmente), tiene un buenísimo guión, es muy extenso y elaborado de tal manera que hace no parezca de relleno cierta situación, de modo que, al final todo encaja perfectamente. Al ser la remasterización de uno de los primeros trabajos de Lucas Arts en 3D, y me parece excelente que la llegada a la plataforma de Steam haya sido un éxito con, hasta su Soundtrack en venta.Hablando de Soundtrack, es fascinate. Tiene Jazz, instrumentales clásico, románticos y le da un placer al oido esuchar tan sagradas melodías compuestas por Peter McConnell, que dice, haber ido a México para poder realizar su banda sonora.Si buscan un juego para pasar el rato y sacarle el jugo a los logros, éste es uno de los buenos. Compralo, no te arrepentirás, es un hecho que las avemturas gráficas son grandiosas para abrir tu mente y hacerte ver la lógica.",76561198091429493,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091429493,0
